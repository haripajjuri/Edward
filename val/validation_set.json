The risk variant known as 1A(MTNR1A) gene basically turns off or on the DNA (through methylation). This is another fascinating epigenetic (a new field of genetics studying how our environment changes or genes) mechanism regulating function. The result people who can do this have less receptors and are not sensitive to melatonin and tolerate nights much better. The people with this gene variant can sleep in bright light without any difficulty as well.\nHmm all those years you wondered why you couldn’t stay awake at a night job and your peers seemed to have no problems.\nSleep is very complex and poorly understood.",

We can hep you ease tension and pain,help prevent injuries, increase your range of movement and adjust any imbalances.\nOur stretch therapy (AIS technique) allows the body to repair itself and also to prepare for daily activity. The AIS technique involves the method of holding each stretch for only two seconds. This method of stretching is also known to work with the body’s natural physiological makeup to improve circulation and increase the elasticity of muscle joins and fascia. The AIS method of muscle lengthening and fascial release is a type of Athletic Stretching Technique that provides effective, dynamic, facilitated stretching of major muscle groups, but more importantly, AIS provides functional and physiological restoration of superficial and deep fascial planes.\nAIS is important for injury prevention recovery, as well as performance enhancement.\nAIS is something that everyone can benefit from. One of the many things that makes AIS superior in dealing with flexibility problems is that it has no age and very few contraindication limits.

They don't want to read magnificent, but boring anatomy textbooks, stuffed with medical level information.\nInstead, the author made a book with clear images, that contain only the necessary information needed, to create a realistic human form.\nMost pictures in the book are self-explanatory. The text part of this book is only about 2%.\nThe concept of this book came from co-author Uldis Zarins, classically trained sculptor, with 20 years of sculpting experience, looking for good visual anatomy book for his students, that would help to explain the forms of the human figure. After years of fruitless searching, Uldis decided to roll up his sleeves and take one for the team. So, he embarked on an epic quest to create a book for solid anatomical reference for any aspiring artist.\nThe book contains images of various examples of different postures, such as a twisted torso, the movement of arms etc. This means you don't have to guess anymore how each muscle will look from any angle.\n\"A secret weapon\" to making a realistic human form.\nWhat sets apart good classical artists from others? Major factors are the skills and practice of course, but good live model makes a huge difference! If you have a good reference, you won’t need a live model anymore. Be inspired, and don’t waste your precious time on the search for images in google, basically, everything you need is in this book!",

It's really not that big of a deal, but I just feel bad there is nothing I can do to help, watching them wheel them away on the bed screaming, and then bringing them back asleep and waiting for them to wake up, which is never a pleasant thing if you have never experienced that.\nUnfortunately unlike Lucy he has had an infection that has been with him for a month, no antibiotic has cured it, not only that but the puss and fluid have not drained. So they will make an incision to let it drain before they put in the tubes the bad part is it's very painful, so the doctors tell me. Luckily Talmadge is a tough little boy, most of the time during his ear infections (9 since November) he never really cried, or woke up a lot at night, the only indication I ever has was a fever and loss of appetite. So hopefully he will not be to miserable when it's over.\nOh! How not fun! It never DOES get easier to see your kids cry because they are scared or hurt. But at least he won't remember it, and it will help him out a ton in the long (and sounds like short) run.\nPoor little guy! I can not even imagine what he must feel like.

    "text": "Thymoquinone protects DRG neurons from axotomy-induced cell death.\nOBJECTIVE: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a significant health problem that is linked to sensory, motor, and autonomic deficits. This pathological condition leads to a reduced quality of life in most affected individuals. Schwann cells (SCs) play a crucial role in the repair of PNI. Effective agents that promote SC activation may facilitate and accelerate peripheral nerve repair. Thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive component of Nigella sativa seeds, has an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. In the present study, the neuroprotective efficacy of TQ was investigated by using a laser microdissection technique in a mouse PNI model.\nMETHODS: Single cells were isolated from dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of 6-8-week-old mice, maintained in defined culture conditions and treated with or without TQ at different concentrations. Axons were cut (axotomy) using a controllable laser microbeam to model axonal injury in vitro. Under fluorescence microscopy, cell viability was evaluated using the fluorescent dyes. The behavior of the cells was continuously monitored with time-lapse video microscopy.\nRESULTS: TQ significantly increased neuronal survival by promoting the survival and proliferation of SCs and fibroblasts, as well as the migration of SCs. Furthermore, TQ improved the ability to extend neurites of axotomized neurons. The regenerative effect of TQ was dose-dependent suggesting a target specificity. Our studies warrant further preclinical and clinical investigations of TQ as a potential regenerative agent to treat peripheral nerve injuries.\nCONCLUSION: TQ exhibits a regenerative potential for the treatment of damaged peripheral nerves.",

The Yacht Club is on the wind protected left side of the big bay, the rest of the shoreline looks like Miami, or Ft. Lauderdale, or Puerto Vallarta. Our first impression was to get what we needed and get out. It was crowded boats on the hook, mooring balls, and a lot of crap tied around the area. We found the marina and fuel docks, met with the management of the thing to get permission to buy some fuel and did just that. They didn’t even have any potable (drinking) water at the dock. (so they said). Turns out it is harder than you would think to find potable water from a hose. Normally, there is drinking water accessible via a water hose just like you have attached to your house. There isn’t a fee for the water since you are purchasing fuel. But we found that once we left Puerto Vallarta, we couldn’t find water until we were so far south that we were almost to Guatamala. The snooty factor in Acapulco is about a 9 on the 10 point snooty scale.\nDidn’t even drag a camera out.\nAcapulco helds no interest for us…so goodbye Acapulco.",

    "text": "Marketers are employed in the public sector as well as the private sector.\nMost people think of marketing as a strictly private sector activity, but the reality is people with sales and marketing backgrounds are hired by government agencies in a number of capacities. Government agencies at the local, state and federal level all employ marketing professionals in areas including, but not limited to, public relations, property disposal, bond sales and purchasing.\nAlmost all major government agencies have their own public-relations staff, and in many cases it is a stand-alone department with a public relations or media director and several support staff. Government agency PR departments are responsible for producing news releases, holding press conferences, and generally promoting activities of the agency, such as tourism or encouraging new businesses to move into the area.\nGovernment agencies are constantly buying supplies, equipment and other property and selling off old equipment and property. The departments tasked with disposing of this government property often hire individuals with a background in marketing. Their job is to assist the agency in coming up with creative ways to sell or otherwise dispose of obsolete government property.\nMost government agencies have to follow complicated regulations for purchasing supplies and equipment. In many cases, agencies can only buy from certain suppliers or can only buy goods within specific price ranges. Agencies often hire purchasing agents with marketing backgrounds to help them manage their purchases, including setting criteria for suppliers and establishing price ranges. Government purchasing agents must be very familiar with current purchasing regulations at their agency.\nLocal, state and federal agencies sometimes sell bonds to finance capital improvement projects in their jurisdictions. These agencies hire bond and securities marketing specialists to prepare bond prospectuses for investors, which detail the terms of the bond, and to organize marketing campaigns to sell the bonds. Bond marketing specialists also typically manage media relations for bond campaigns.\nBrowne, Clayton. \"Are There Marketing Jobs in the Government?\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/there-marketing-jobs-government-22921.html.

What can I do?\nTo fix this it needs to implement a few permissions to wine and it should be installed to external storage. Temporary - until the next wine will be published - it can be done using some apk-editor/modification-utility through adding those permissions manually to the manifest. Also create some new folder on /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/. Call this folder \"org.winehq.wine\" and add in there another folder like \"drive_z\".\nUse a sophisticated file-manager to connect the wine-app with the \"org.winehq.wine\"-folder and create the connection to drive_z, i.e. \"Z:\\\" through wineconfig.\n4. permission to mount/unmount filesystems.\nGood Morning. I have the same problem. It says \"Access Denied\" every time I want to execute an .exe file.

Excuse my English, I'm from Argentina, I speak Spanish. Can you be a little clearer? I do not understand why I do not handle my English very well. Thank you!\nHello, I am new to this forum. I've been able to modify the app manifest to install on the sd card, grant read/write permission, and mount/unmount file systems. I couldn't quite find the other permissions that were suggested. Also, do you mind elaborating on how to do this? Or which app could be used to do so?\nThanks! But it finally makes sense now. \"Access denied\" must come up whenever trying to run a program that isn't compiled for ARM.

This backpack is from Urban Outfitters which I actually picked up in the sale for the bargainous price of £20. I’m not one to carry around a lot of things with me on a daily basis – these are the main things I had. I had just bought the two Models Own nail polish featured above – Boots are currently having a 2 for £8 offer on them, so now is the time to snap some up. I’m looking forward to trying the Hed Kandi collaboration – a have seen it on a few friends nails and it looks fabulous.\nI always need some hand cream with me because I hate how dry my hand gets from using cheap soap at work – this works a treat. The superbalm from Liz Earle is really good for lips and any dry patches you might have – it works wonders on elbows! I am loving the new Revlon Lip Butters – I often find lipsticks really drying so this is a perfect solution.\nMy sheep keyring was from the Mark Fast goodie bag I managed to grab while I was at fashion week – I like this little dude on my keys, don’t you? I just picked up this case for my phone and I love it – it made me feel like I had a whole new phone again.\nI always throw this beanie in my bag to keep my hair dry and under control in this ridiculous weather we have been having in the UK. Lastly is my purse from Zara which my mum got me at Christmas – skulls and spiky studs, pretty much me in purse form.",

Featuring the voices of Christopher Lloyd, Kelly Ripa, Nicollette Sheridan, Tim Curry, Ed Begley Jr., Robert Patrick, and others, the film’s over-reliance on what they felt was a fascinating and relatable children’s plot involving the young insects bogs down the film which would have benefited greatly by focusing exclusively on the astronauts.\nThis is especially apparent as it seems both completely awkward and like some strange “surprise party” styled prank on the audience in the film’s conclusion when heroic Buzz Aldrin himself walks out during the end titles to discredit every single thing that had transpired in the fictitious animated adventure, most likely to distance NASA from what can truly be called a cinematic waste of “space.” So, in other words, grab a swatter and some bug spray as that'll teach kids to imagine that houseflies have \"the right stuff.\"",

    "text": "There is a lot of discussion right now about stress reduction. Today we see an increased work load of mental health professionals, increased occurrences of abuse or violence faced by social workers and other therapists, and the terrible struggles facing our returning veterans. All of these things have increased our awareness of the stressful elements of our society and the impact those elements have on both our clients and the professionals whose job it is to help.\nAs a social worker I am aware of the impact of work related stress on me, my family and my ability to do my job effectively. In my exploration of this topic, I found the blog of a young British social worker who wrote a blog called “Fighting Monsters.” She has since closed the blog, for personal reasons she did not disclose. But I was very struck by the quote she references while explaining the name of her blog.\n“Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one.” Nietzsche.\nFor her that was about the monster “mental disorder and illness.” For me it applies to all of the various ways we want to help and give care. If we don’t pay attention, we will fall into the very trap we are trying to help our clients climb out of. Stress, anxiety and depression are the most common warnings of the beginning fall. As professionals who work to support clients facing any number of difficult challenges, we need to be sure we have the appropriate tools to manage stress. But knowing stress is a problem and doing something about it are frequently two different things. It’s a bit of the forest from the trees problem. When we are standing in the middle of the stress we really think we are handling it quite well. If we can step back a few steps, we frequently find that we are doing a pretty poor job of it.\nThe most amazing part of this discussion, is that everything we use when we talk with clients are things that are available to us as professionals – and vice versa. Everything we talk about in these articles on stress are important for clients and therapists alike. There are four important elements in any stress management approach – TALK, WRITE, THINK, MOVE. The next four posts will take them on.",

Any girl would be excited for Christmas because that’s when boyfriends prove their worth! But there are always worries that go along with a season that makes you think of love – does he like me, is he being faithful, do we spend enough time together? Honestly, the only solution to all of these problems is to lock him up and tie him to a chair to make sure you two will be together… FOREVER!\nMoving on from all of the tsundere, we are happy to introduce another original character, Yuukin Aikyou. She is just like any other girl – caring, loving, sweet and will make sure that she does whatever is necessary to keep you two together. Hear that? Whatever is necessary. Yanderes are most commonly characterized by their crazy side, be it in love or otherwise. Check out this 4koma for a first hand example.\nWatch out, because Yuu is possessive of everything. But our yandere, Yuukin, did not gain this personality by chance. Her father was often away on business trips which left her mother always alone. To make matters worse, her mother did not understand Japanese and ended up ostracized from her community due to her foreign appearance. Over the years she developed a tendency to go into hysterical fits of depression and anxiety because of her isolation. All the meanwhile, their daughter grew up with misaligned values and a warped idea of what love is. It seems like Yuu gained these “yanderu” tendencies by absorbing the negative emotions of her household, which eventually fell apart right before she got into middle school. It’s certainly ironic that their family name is Aikyou (愛嬌), which means attractive and pleasant.\nPrevious story Do you REALLY know what a Magic Circle is?",

They are easily applied around the body and is very practical for those who sit behind a computer or desk all day. It is also suitable for people who travel a lot to ease tension in their shoulders and neck.

    "text": "Military architectural designs are often overlooked in vernacular architecture due to the widespread use of standardized plans at military installations. However, factors including climate in certain regions force the development of new designs for military bases that are better suited to local conditions. This is arguably the case for the Panama Houses of the former Charleston Navy Yard, which are an example of a vernacular building type imported from a foreign context. While scholars have looked from a broad perspective at the Navy Yard and the more prominent structures, no study has been completed considering the history and form of the Panama House. Bringing together architectural evidence from this group of buildings and U.S. housing in the former Panama Canal Zone, this study explores the origins of the Panama House and the factors that brought it to Charleston, ultimately positioning this vernacular form within the context of the region and United States military installations.",

Read abstract here.\nIn all the debate through the years about the cause in the rise in c-section rates, the role money plays gets little attention. The public is loath to think that the cesarean section being performed on a loved one results from the physician needing to make a boat payment rather than patient need. The doctors, of course, blame the lawyers claiming that lawsuits make the doctors do more cesarean sections to protect themselves from litigation. In an interesting new study available from the Social Science Research Network, MIT and University of British Columbia researchers analyzed records of births in California and Texas and have found that when the patient is a physician she is 10% less likely to receive a c-section delivery. The authors conclude that financial incentives are most likely responsible for this behavior.\nPost a Comment to \"New Study suggests doctors do more cesarean sections because of money.

The full presentation can be found on The statistics that have been published section of this website.\nIn April 2014, the Director of Public Health Science at NHS Health Scotland and two Professors of Public Health wrote to NRS, to ask it to match the ethnic information that was provided when deaths were registered in 2012 with what was recorded in the 2011 census for the same people, in order to assess the accuracy of the information that was recorded at death registration (and also to carry out similar work in respect of later years’ deaths, in order to obtain an ongoing measure of the quality of the data).\nThe data linkage part of this project was the first such piece of work done by the newly-established Data Sharing and Linkage Service, which is now part of the Scottish Informatics and Linkage Collaboration. As a ‘pilot’ project, it took much longer than would now be the case because of the need to establish various sets of rigorous governance, administrative arrangements and technical procedures. Not until May 2016 could NRS link together the ethnicity data from the death registration records for 2012 (and 2013 and 2014) and from the Census records (if any) for those people. A report on the results of the analysis was published on 14 March 2017.\nThe report concluded that the data on the ethnicity of the deceased person were not (at present) suitable for calculating reliable mortality rates for most ethnicities. It identified some ways that NRS could try to improve the quality of future data. The full report is available in The quality of the data for 2012 to 2014 section of this website.",

It was Jackson's first late-night appearance in 14 years.\nUnlike most performers, Jackson took over the entire set. She remodeled the stage with dazzling set pieces, and brought along a crew of dancers and musicians to complete the performance. Much like the music video, Jackson uses dances from Ghana, Nigeria, Grenada, Trinidad, and the United States to give the performance a worldly vibe.\nIn an interview withiHeartRadio, Jackson revealed that she has had a passion for Latin music for some time. \"I've always loved Latin music, and obviously, the African music is there and always been an influence,\" she stated. \"Coming from what Daddy Yankee does in reggaeton, it's inspiration. It's reggae music, which brings you back to the African vibe, the whole bit. It was really nice working with him.

The community dissolved in 1908. Remaining members moved to the Harvard Shaker Village to continue practicing their religious devotion and live out the rest of their lives.",

    "text": "The human eye has been called the most complex organ in our body. It's amazing that something so small can have so many working parts. But when you consider how difficult the task of providing vision really is, perhaps it's no wonder after all.\nThe human eye is like a camera. Light comes in through the cornea, a clear cover that is like the glass of a camera's aperture. The pupil, an opening that opens and closes a little like a camera shutter, controls the amount of light coming in.\nSome carry fluids (such as tears and blood) to lubricate or nourish the eye.\nOthers are muscles that allow the eye to move.\nSome parts protect the eye from injury (such as the lids and the epithelium of the cornea).\nAnd some are messengers, sending sensory information to the brain (such as the pain-sensing nerves in the cornea and the optic nerve behind the retina.\nAs a conscious sense organ the eye allows vision. Rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth. The human eye can distinguish about 16 million colors.\nHuman eye is divided in two main part front part is called cornea and back part is called sclera attached with cornea. Inner side is aqueous humor. Lens and muscles are present.\nHuman eye vision is determined by brain area near occipital lobe.\nEye is protected by anti bacterial material fluished over the cornea,eye brows, and eye lids.",

    "text": "Compact Camping Concepts’s No Weld Trailer Rack Brackets now allow folks with basic DIY skills and tools to build sturdy, long-lasting trailer racks. The brackets help you to make solid corner connections with no welding required.\nPurchase a bracket set and source your 1.5” square tubing locally to keep cost down.\nPurchase a bracket set with precut 1.5” square tubing sections.\nPurchase a complete rack ready for painting and bolting together.\nTo build a trailer rack: what you are basically doing is creating two hoops and connecting them together. The hoops can be side-to-side in the front and rear, or front-to-back on each side. You connect the hoops together to increase the overall rigidity of your rack.\nThe primary bracket of the rack system is the corner bracket. With corner brackets, there are two types of joints.\nWhere a tubing section intersects another.\nFor applications where the racks will attach to a flat deck or pad, we have a base bracket. Rack uprights can also be bolted directly to the side of frames and trailer boxes.\nBegin by determining the shape and size of your rack. I do this by sketching planned rack. Then use the sketch to figure out the number of bracket needed and tube lengths.\nOnce you have received your brackets, the first step is cutting your piece to size. This could be done with a hack saw, but that would take some time. A better way to cut your tubing is using a 4.5” angle grinder with a cutoff wheel attached.\nAfter you have your tubing cut to length, lay the piece out on the floor the way they go together.\nThen going one section at a time, position the brackets at the joint positions, square the joints up and mark the bracket holes.\nThen painting can be as simple as a quick scuff up with 220 sandpaper, a wipe down with something like xlyene to clean and a coat or two of enamel rattle can paint.\nFinally, assemble everything with 5/16” x 2 1/4″ bolt, load up whatever you plan to load on your rack and get out for some fun.",

SurfaceScapes puts an interactive map on the Surface, which you can interact with by moving around specially designed miniatures. All of the rules you need to run the game (e.g. movement, powers, etc.) are built into the game, and you can interact with your character through a handheld device (e.g. an iPod touch or smart phone).\nPutting aside snide comments about 4E finally realizing its video game roots, I think this is pretty darn cool. As a GM, I love the idea of using Campaign Cartographer to create rich, beautiful maps, complete with sound effects and event-triggered background music, but it’s hard to pull off in the real world (not impossible, just challenging).\nSomething like SurfaceScapes could let you do all that, while simultaneously abstracting away all those crunchy RPG rules (as we already do every time we fire up Dragon Age, Fallout or Mass Effect). I think games like D&D (be it 3.x or 4.x) led themselves to this sort of digitization, and I could see the hobby moving in this direction someday.\nBut (and you knew there had to be one) … there’s a real problem with cost. These Microsoft Surface units cost upwards of $12,500 (see Wikipedia for cost estimates) making them unrealistic for most people’s weekly game, and putting them out of reach of most hobby stories.\nI also wouldn’t really want this to replace my conventional game — I like using my imagination for all of this, regardless of how cumbersome the rules can be at times.

I think many of us got used to watching TV shows for grown-ups as kids, watching kids shows as grown-ups (which all parents do) and similar.

Which no matter how you slice it, is a pretty good journal. The manuscript describes the results from heroic numbers of biochemical experiments, purifications and assays to show that a 'calcium sensor' molecule called calmodulin binds to the cardiac sodium channel. This feat is all the more impressive when one considers that Maen along with the Van Petegem crew started the project by setting up the biochemistry in the newly founded lab.

    "text": "When private funding for the annual Incline Village fireworks display dried up in 2006, a group of concerned citizens, local merchants and community leaders got together and came up with the idea for Red, White and Tahoe Blue. A multi-day celebration of our country’s independence, RW&TB features numerous events, concerts and one of the best fireworks shows in the nation. The festival is family-oriented with many events geared toward kids like chalk drawing and ice cream eating contests, a bike parade and a community fair and barbecue featuring carnival games, music and food. Other events include pancake breakfasts, a hometown parade, a veterans tribute and a wine and cheese tasting. Various bands and musicians play around town, and there’s one big concert every year at the main stage on the Village Green (past acts have included Elvin Bishop, Billy Ray Cyrus and Grand Funk Railroad). The highlight of the whole celebration is when the Reno Philharmonic takes the stage as fireworks light up the sky, synchronized with the music. Incline Village’s homespun Red, White and Tahoe Blue celebration has been rated one of the 10 best in the nation, and the fireworks rate in the top five. Many of the events are free but some have an entry fee. Please note that the population of Incline swells to more than triple its usual size Independence week, so you’ll need to show up early for events and have patience. The beaches in Incline, where some of the events are held, are private and not accessible to the general public.",

But how many of us live like we really believe that? We forget how absolutely needy we are of God’s grace. Second Peter 1 says, “His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness.” Did you notice the verb is the perfect tense: a definitive action that has occurred in the past with continuing results into the future? Jesus died to give us eternal life and now He lives to give us grace. So, let’s remember His generous grace that allows us to live. By the grace of God, we live today.

We’ve learned what we needed to from them, and we no longer carry them daily. Like your best friend in fifth grade whom you chose to drift apart from, but in hindsight you see that you now listen to your inner authority over others’.\nSome experiences are foundations. We’ve built upon them, and we continue to learn and grow from them. Like your religious history, that opened the door for choosing an even deeper and ongoing spirituality.\nHow about our challenging experiences? The ones in which we wonder what the right choice was. Should I have stayed in that relationship? What if I had not moved? Did I choose the right career?\nDid I make the right choice? Did I take the right path?\nOn your spiritual journey, you’ve done nothing wrong.\nIn order to be who we are born to become, life could not have happened ANY other way. All of our experiences, all of our choices, led us to where we are here. And here is RIGHT where we are supposed to be.\nLook at it as present time, rather than past.\nIn order to be who I was born to become, life could not be happening any other way.\nOur current challenges, our current choices — those are the ones we will look back at one day and examine the journey in hindsight.\nBut can you see your Divine journey in them right now, in the thick of the ick?\nMaybe that muck that we’re stuck in is actually pudding. Or cake batter. Or better yet, cheesecake. What if the hurdles are actually stairs? Could the detour really be our most supportive road, and could being late truly arrive us in right time?\nWe can be pretty good at looking back and holding space for it all having worked out the way it was supposed to.\nNow let’s trust that it is happening in real-time.\nAre you currently experiencing a challenging situation or aspect? Can you embrace that you are right where you are supposed to be, and in the process of becoming who you are born to be? Maybe give that some thought over a piece of cheesecake.",

This is the second season which has been filmed in Andalucia.\nStaff have been spotted preparing scenery in the area of El Chorrilo de Pechina in Sierra Alhamilla, where Exodus: Gods and Kings was also filmed recently, and the Faro de Mesa Roldan lighthouse near Carboneras. Sets are being constructed using materials specially prepared in Belfast and then transported to Spain, to be put together on location.\nThe Alcazaba in Almeria, the city’s Moorish citadel, is also to feature as a palace.\nAlmerian locations will represent either Dorne (as was the case with the Alcazar in Seville) or Essos.\nOther locations include the Muralla de Jayrán, and the Cautivo de Tabernas, where 100 horses will be used, making it likely that this location will be Essos, home to the Dothraki, a nomadic horse-riding warrior tribe similar to the Mongols.\nShooting will take place from 10 to 23 October, with 2700 extras being used – 1800 men and 900 women.\nSeason 6 is expected to air in April 2016, like previous seasons of Game of Thrones.\nTo see which movies were filmed around Almeria province, see our list of films shot in Andalucia. The other Spanish locations for this season of Game of Thrones (Juego de Tronas in Spanish) are Girona, in the north-east, and Peñiscola, in Castellon.",

It was Johns Hopkins' first clinical healthcare facility established outside of the United States. JHS' objectives then included conducting research, education and providing patient care. The clinical arm was initially named as Johns Hopkins-NUH International Medical Centre and co-located with the National University Hospital (NUH).\nThe Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is a 2,400-bed acute tertiary psychiatric hospital. It has wards for inpatients as well as two specialist outpatient clinics. Started by the British colonial government in 1928 as the Mental Hospital, the institute was renamed Woodbridge Hospital in 1951. In 1993, it shifted to its current Hougang/Buangkok campus and was reorganized as the Institute of Mental Health/Woodbridge Hospital (IMH/WH). Since 2007/2008, the use of the Woodbridge Hospital name has been dropped.\nSt Luke’s Hospital, started in 1996, is a community hospital that provides medical, nursing and rehabilitative care for the needy elderly. The hospital started out as St Luke's Hospital for the Elderly Sick but was renamed to the current name in 2004. Despite this, the hospital continues its core focus on geriatric medicine and care.\nSince 2005, the hospital has had an outpatient clinic to serve discharged patients returning for follow-up care.\nSt Luke's Hospital is located in Bukit Batok in the western part of Singapore.",

Atlantic westerlies dominated in December with Storm Deirdre on the 15th.\nThe first week of December was mild and unsettled with low-pressure systems and associated weather fronts traversing the country frequently in a mainly westerly airflow. This gave rain or showers every day with windy conditions at times, especially on the 7th and 8th. The second week continued with the generally unsettled theme, although less active on the 9th and 10th, as a transient area of high pressure moved over the country. High pressure established itself over Scandinavia on the 12th and the airflow over Ireland backed to south or southeast up to the 15th. The bulk of the rain during this period fell in the South. On the 15th, Storm Deirdre deepened rapidly as it moved across the country giving widespread heavy rain and very strong winds. The remainder of the third week was Atlantic dominated again in a south or south-westerly air flow with rain or showers on most days. It settled down towards Christmas as high pressure built from the south over the country giving a mostly dry Christmas and final week of the month and year.",

However, it does feature an Audi A4 and we get to see it get a very satisfying wash in this new video from the Car Cleaning Guru.\nIn this video, the Guru’s neighbor has a B9-generation Audi A4 as a company car but even though it’s just a company car, it’s far too grimy looking for the Guru’s taste. So he does his neighbor a favor and gives the dirty A4 a proper clean.\nI’m not sure about you but there’s something so satisfying to me about watching these sorts of videos. Watching the process of applying all of the products, letting them soak and seeing the grime simply melt away, then seeing everything get power-washed away and seeing the final clean product is almost therapeutic.\nIt doesn’t hurt that the car in this video is white, which looked really dirty and gross prior to the wash. Afterward, though, it was glistening and looked fantastic. Even just a simple diesel-powered Audi A4 in a pretty basic spec looked like something truly special after its thorough cleaning.\nThe products used are also really impressive and shows how far car-care products have come. Gone are the days when I was a young enthusiast of just getting a bucket of water, some soap and the garden hose. Now, there are so many awesome cleaning products that really melt away grime and make the car truly clean.\nMy only issue with cleaning cars this nicely is that I feel like they shouldn’t be driven afterwards. They look so sparkly clean, I don’t want to think about how dirty they’ll get after one drive in the rain and then all of that hard work is gone. Still, it’s mighty impressive and this video is very satisfying on this Thursday morning.",

He put a needle in a Snickers bar and showed it to his sister, Hogan said, who reported it to police.\nHogan said that based on the ages of the children involved, the cooperation of their families, and other mitigating factors, no formal charges will be filed against the children. The children will be dealt with by their parents.\nBoth families apologized for the incident, understanding the serious impact it had on the community, Hogan said.\nAlso this week, investigators in Gloucester Township, New Jersey say a report there of needles in Halloween candy has been determined to be false.",

Printing prayers on condoms satisfies nobody.\nIn all countries, in all centuries, the primary reason for government to set up schools is to undermine the politically weak by convincing their children that the leaders are good and their policies are wise. The core is religious intolerance. The sides simply change between the Atheists, Catholics, Protestants, Unitarians, etc., depending whether you are talking about the Soviet Union, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, America, etc. A common second reason is to prepare the boys to go to war and the girls to cheer them on.\nThe Left/Right scale is a misleading way of comparing political systems. It doesn't measure anything.\nCharter schools are just public schools on a slightly longer leash. A dog on a long leash is still a dog on a leash.",

    "text": "I finally watched Objectified, one of Gary Hustwit’s Design Film Trilogy, which is about the world of design, particularly industrial design. It explores our complex relationship between “manufactured” everyday objects and the designers. The designers who re-examine, re-evaluate and re-invent our manufactured environment on a daily basis.\nThrough in-depth conversation with the most influential designers in the world, it reminds me of the thing we use every day, that we barely think about, have been designed by someone, with more or less, thought.\nI wouldn’t call myself a designer. I think I prefer to call myself a maker because I usually make things that are not necessarily functional. Regardless of that, the film was very inspiring because I believe that art/craft/design is another form of language, which is a visual tool to communicate with others. Every individual who interacts with an object adds their own interpretation and meaning and it creates a unique connection between a maker, an object and a user. From my perspective, I think memories or emotional links between objects and viewers/users make objects become alive.\nHere is Dieter Rams, a German industrial designer’s a list of 10 essentials for good design.\nGood design should be innovative design.\nGood design should make a product useful.",

Unlike ducks, coots bring their food to the surface before eating it; this results in frequent cases of food stealing (4). They are opportunistic birds, and may feed in grasslands at certain times of the year (6). During winter, large flocks may gather on large lakes and reservoirs (10), these gatherings are relatively peaceful compared to the fierce territorial aggression seen during the breeding season (2). The nest, a mound of dead reeds, is usually built amongst emergent vegetation (6). From mid-March, between 6 and 9 speckled eggs are laid (occasionally up to 15 eggs, though these large clutches may be laid by more than one female (10)). The eggs are incubated by both parents for up to 24 days (6). The chicks leave the nest a few days after hatching, and reach independence at around 8 weeks of age (6). Two broods are produced a year, but occasionally a third brood may occur (6).\nSeen from the train between Airport and center.\nswampy areas near railway station.

Lew spoke on four TV talk shows, setting out Obama’s priorities ahead of an expected showdown this fall.\nBy early November, Congress must raise the legal limit on the country’s borrowing authority or risk an unprecedented default on the government’s debt.\n“We need to get the debt limit extended in a way that doesn’t create a crisis,” Lew said.\nLew, who was Obama’s budget director in 2011, reiterated the president’s stance that he would not consider short-term spending cuts, nor would he offset defense spending cuts with reductions in other government programs.\n“The president has made crystal clear, he’s not going to negotiate over the debt limit,” Lew said in an interview on ABC.\nRepublicans have eyed this budget deadline as a way to roll back steep spending cuts for defense programs. But that is not an option, Lew said.\nAsked about the possibility of a federal response to Detroit’s recent bankruptcy declaration, Lew threw cold water on any chances the struggling city will get federal aid.\n“Detroit is going to have to work with its creditors on this,” Lew told ABC.",

Although I have all the manuals, I can not find what speed it writes at. After having it for 5 years I want to buy some re-writable discs. They ask me what speed my drive writes. How can I find this out? Went to HP site to search, with no luck. Tried to email them and they want serial#. Sorry but I am not ripping the drive out to find out. Any one know the answer to this question ?\nThanks John. Downloaded this tool and it only tells me it has a read speed of 48x. Write speed is NA. So I still don't know what speed discs need. I have only ever bought recordable discs in past and have had no problems with them. A little late on my part but I just checked my recordable discs and they are 12x, so I assume I would use the same for rewritable. Am I right?\nIf it tells you the write speed is N/A, it's not a CD writer!\nDid you try checking the speed with a CD-RW in the drive? Here's what I see with no disk in the drive, this is a DVD DL burner.\nsorry I did not read scan information thoroughly. I did not notice dropdown at top of page. I was reading info for my cd drive. Dropdown listed my cd-r drive. It is 12x. Thank you so much for your help.\nGlad you got it sorted out. I forgot to mention the dropdown.",

    "text": "Mohd Sayuti, M. Norazizi Sham (2014) Early Design Space Exploration of Hard Real-Time Embedded Networks-on-Chip. PhD thesis, University of York.\nNetworks-On-Chip (NoC) is seen as a solution for addressing the limitation of the current bus-based communication in embedded systems. Some of these systems are designed for executing hard real-time services. In such systems, the services have to deliver output within strict timing constraints since the lateness in output delivery could cause severe consequences to human life. Task mapping is a crucial step for integrating an application and a hardware platform during system design. Existing schedulability analyses are available to evaluate the hard real-time performance of task mapping, but exploring the vast number of task mappings at the early design stage can be challenging due to several issues. These issues are caused by the influence of other design parameters on the hard real-time performance produced by task mapping, the existence of conflicting design objectives with the hard real-time system constraints, the restriction of the current hard real-time evaluation functions for searching alternative task mappings and the enormous evaluation of population-based search heuristics in the current task mapping techniques. This thesis proposes several design space exploration techniques to address these issues. The first technique is proposed for addressing the problem of optimising multiple design parameters while keeping all tasks and messages in the system fully schedulable. The second technique addresses the conflicting objectives problem using a multi-objective optimisation approach. The third technique yields a new metric that is useful for improving task mappings with unschedulable tasks and messages. Finally, the last technique is a new mapping algorithm for constructing a feasible task mapping rather than have to evaluate a population of task mappings to achieve the same objective.",

Chanda could answer yes…but she chooses not to. Instead, she has chosen to overcome with a smile when there is nothing to smile about and give to others out of her poverty. Amidst the dreary circumstances she calls life, Chanda’s beauty and strength rises higher.\nChanda lives in Sermapore, India with her parents and six siblings where one bed sleeps all the children. Her father is a rickshaw driver and her mother is a maid. Together they barely bring home enough money to feed their family of 10 with rotted food. Her father usually returns from work drunk and abusive. If these circumstances were not grim enough, Chanda was born with Cardiomegaly, commonly known as an enlarged heart. Her condition causes shortness of breath and extreme fatigue keeping Chanda from basic tasks, but also from her passion – dancing. Without surgery, her condition would eventually cause an early death.\nBut, the heart surgery Chanda needed would never have been a possibility for this family except for the work of Calcutta Mercy Ministries. Through this ministry, Chanda received heart surgery at no cost to her family. Now, she is able to live without slowing down or avoiding certain activities due to her weak heart…she is even free to dance. Each of us can give wings to a child in need by giving them a chance to overcome their circumstances too.\n*All net proceeds from “Overcome” will be used to medically treat children in need through Calcutta Mercy Ministries.",

The tool I don’t have yet is a froe, which is used to split out blanks from a round log and a shaving horse will make the process easier, but not required.

This will cover the lengths of everything from a rake or hoe to a hammer. They will need to be seasoned of course and that means coating the ends so they don’t dry to quickly and cause the wood to split. There is something called Anchorseal that the lumber industry uses to for this purpose, but hobbyist also just use exterior grade latex paint.\nHaving a stock of handle material air-drying is an investment that every homesteader should do it they can. From what amounts to a chunk of firewood you can get a valuable resource for next to no money. Consider it an investment in future tool needs.",

Once you're ready to see some homes you like, you simply email us and we set up showings for you. We've shown up to 16 homes in one day but generally 6-8 is a good number.\nFinancing is a major step in buying your home. We work with several lenders. We will ask you to get qualified early in the process. There is little to be gained by getting your hopes up about buying a home if you can't get financing. This is a critical step in the process. A prequalification letter can be done in a day or two. It is wise to have this early. Some sellers require that you have the letter prior to submitting an offer.\nOur team will work hard to find the right home at the right price. We won't hesitate to suggest you walk away if we believe it is not in your best interest. We're after lifelong customers and referrals...not the short term, quick sale.\nWhether you are a first time buyer looking for a starter home or a corporate transfer looking for a $850,000 home, we always deliver the same class of service: Client First.\nBuilding a home? How much do you REALLY know about construction?\nVisit HomeSaleIndy's profile on Pinterest.",

    "text": "7th September 1914, Luton: White feathers have been sent to young single men in Luton who have not enlisted. Some of the sillier girls have been convinced by what they read in the papers that any young man not in uniform is an unpatriotic shirker. They do not seem to realise that with so many men joining the army even some former soldiers are finding it difficult to re-enlist. One young man who had served as an officer in the Territorials tried to rejoin his battalion as soon as the war began. The battalion was at full strength and he has been waiting for a commission in another regiment. He would be happy to join the ranks, but has heard that new Territorial battalions are being formed and hopes to be needed by one of them. Despite this he received a white feather in the post. It may also be that single men have family responsibilities, caring for parents or siblings, or are not fit enough to be accepted into the Forces. They say that although Lord Kitchener asked for 200,000 men to join up, over 300,000 have now enlisted and the War Office does not have the resources to equip or train all the new recruits. Even if there were cause to believe a young man may be shirking his duty and to tell him so with a white feather, it would surely be better to give it to him personally and give him a chance to explain himself rather than to take the coward’s course and send a feather anonymously.",

    "text": "Rochester Webelos Cub Scouts were lucky to be able to participate in maple syrup making in Rochester, MA last month. Our neighbor, Wendy Keeler invited us over to watch the process. She taps red maples rather than sugar maples since that is what is available in our area. The maple syrup has a great taste, a little more vanilla flavor, than traditional syrup from sugar maples. She had 11 tapped trees on her property and the cold nights and relatively warm days provided overflowing jugs of sap. The boys watched as she boiled the sap from the trees outside over a arch system fire. The boiling releases a lot of steam so boiling outside is preferable. The boys were surprised to learn that it takes 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of syrup. It also takes 24 hours to boil the thin sap into a thick syrup. We got a taste of the finished product and it was delicious.\nWe also brought a 5 gallon bucket of sap home, thanks to Wendy, and boiled it down to one mason jar worth of syrup. It took 24 hours but it was worth every minute. The syrup was delicious. We are definitely rationing it to make it last as long as possible. It’s a lot of work but the finished product is so sweet.\nI really enjoy working with the Cub Scouts to learn new experiences. I also enjoy working with my clients in real estate to help them buy or sell their property. Please call me with your real estate needs.

This study presents results of DME partial oxidation over a 1.5 wt% Pt/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst under the condition of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 15000-60000 ml/(g·h), molar ratio of O2/DME of 0.5 and 500-700 °C, and this temperature range was also the operation temperature range for intermediate temperature SOFC. The results indicated that the catalyst showed good activity for the selective partial oxidation of DME to H2/syngas. Under the working conditions investigated, DME was completely converted. Increase in reaction temperature enhanced the amount of syngas, but lowered the H2/CO ratio and yield of methane; while increase in reaction GHSV resulted in only slight variation in the distribution of products. The good catalytic activity of Pt supported on Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 for the partial oxidation of DME may be directly associated with the good oxygen storage capacity of the support, which is worth of further investigation to develop materials for application in SOFC. © 2008 CAS/DICP.\nChen, Y. and Shao, Z. and Xu, N. 2008.

Atticus Finch is an educated, highly intellectual man who works for the state. “Atticus met [Scout and Jem’s mother] when he was first elected to the state legislature.” (7) We know he has formal schooling because you must be educated to be elected to most offices. Atticus is hard working, and his job helps the community therefore they value him, whereas the town often comment on how they haven't seen the Ewell’s do one honest day of work. Bob Ewell is an ignorant drunk who has eight kids and no job. His intellectual capacity is nowhere near that of Atticus Finch’s. Judge Taylor is forced to read the riot act to the spectators in the courtroom following Bob Ewell's accusation and “The judge cautioned Bob, too, but Mr. Ewell reminded [Scout] of a deaf-mute. [She] was sure he had never heard the words that Judge Taylor directed at him.” (233) Bob Ewell can’t comprehend half of what people say to him and isn’t very intelligent. Because of this contrast in intellectual capacity, Atticus and Bob are on very different levels of understanding, which is sure to create conflict sooner or later.\nDialogue Essays: Do Vampires Really Exist?\nThe Day of the Sale...

State Science Standards are intended to be a foundation for local curriculum and not a limit of what district's can do.\nThe process for developing the Kansas Science Education Standards has been very difficult since 1999. In 2004, the writing process of the committee was stopped in the middle of the development of the standards, leaving an unfinished flawed document.

I think the integrity is a big piece to it,\" O&apos;Donnell said.\nNevada&apos;s effective monopoly on sports betting ended last spring, when the Supreme Court ruled the ban should be lifted. Casinos in seven other states — Rhode Island, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New Mexico — now accept wagers on sports. The list is expected to grow by next year with numerous states considering bills.\nAnd there&apos;s already a hitch that could slow bets: NASCAR this season has decided for the first time to strip drivers of victories if their cars are deemed illegal. There will be a roughly 90-minute inspection after the race and the winner will not be deemed official until the process is completed. Will fans really want to linger around the pay window another couple of hours just to cash in a ticket?\n\"The state&apos;s risk manager will delay any payout until NASCAR releases the official order of finish,\" Kirk said. \"Our casinos will receive an email reminding them of NASCAR&apos;s new procedures the week of Daytona.\"\nThe betting lines supplied by William Hill are set: Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch are 5-1 favorites to win the 2019 Cup series championship. 2018 champ Joey Logano checks in at 7-1.

It is similar to chlorine (hypochlorous acid) in many ways, but with some very distinct advantages.\nHypobromous Acid is stable and effective in pH ranges of 5-9, and therefore does not require acid adjustment, which is necessary for chlorine-based products.\nHypobromous Acid combines with organic compounds to form a bromamine. Chlorine also combines with the same organic compounds to form a chloramine. However, bromamines are 50-100 times more potent biocides than a chloramine, so bromine is a far superior biocide in the presence of organic matter.\nHypobromous Acid is one of the least expensive intervention antimicrobial compounds available.",

In the 1840’s, a group of German noblemen formed a group called the Adelsverein to protect German immigrants coming to Texas and to secure land for them in the Texas Hill Country. Today, that land includes visitor favorites like the towns of Fredericksburg, Comfort, Boerne and New Braunfels.\nGerman immigrants also moved to San Antonio. One such immigrant was Carl Hilmar Guenther, founder of Pioneer Flour Mills. In 1860, he built an elegant home nestled between his mill and the San Antonio River, now known as the Guenther House — a favorite for brunch along the RIver Walk.\nAlso, in the late 1800’s, the King William neighborhood was settled by other prominent German merchants. Today, it’s the state’s first zoned historic district and one of the most stylish residential areas in the city.",

    "text": "Are E-cigarettes Leading More Kids to Smoke?\nToday, thanks to decades of educational efforts about the serious health consequences of inhaled tobacco, fewer young people than ever smoke cigarettes in the United States. So, it’s interesting that a growing of number of middle and high school kids are using e-cigarettes—electronic devices that vaporize flavored liquid that generally contains nicotine.\nE-cigarettes come with their own health risks, including lung inflammation, asthma, and respiratory infections. But their supporters argue that “vaping,” as it’s often called, might provide an option that would help young people steer clear of traditional cigarettes and the attendant future risks of lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, and other serious health conditions. Now, a new NIH-funded study finds that this is—pardon the pun—mostly a pipe dream.\nAnalyzing the self-reported smoking behaviors of thousands of schoolkids nationwide, researchers found no evidence that the availability of e-cigarettes has served to accelerate the decline in youth smoking. In fact, the researchers concluded the opposite: the popularity of e-cigarettes has led more kids—not fewer—to get hooked on nicotine, which meets all criteria for being an addictive substance.",

Currently run by Bernard and Olivier Coste. Based in the Languedoc region of Southern France. The Domaine Montrose coat of arms of three lizards has become the logo used on all of their wines. The name Montrose refers to its geographic location on a volcano (Mont) and to the pink (Rose) flowers from the almond trees surrounding the vineyard. The vineyard is located around the domaine on the “Côtes de Thôngue” terroir in the Mediterranean southern France. They encourage sustainable farming of their 85 hectares in the belief that it protects the environment but also better expresses the local terroir in the wines. There are 3 types of soil volcanic, chalky clay and siliceious-clay gravel. They are able to cultivate local and foreign grape varieties from Rolle to Cabernet Sauvignon, vinify them and then produce beautifully married blends. Fully thermo-controlled steel tanks are used for fermenting and ageing all of the cepages. Wines produced include Chardonnay, Viognier, Rose, Merlot Syrah, Cabernet Syrah. They produce a blended range of red, white and rose wines called La Balade and their prestige wine is called Salamandre. Its 2012 Rose won a silver award at the Decanter World Wine Awards in 2013.\nAlmost akin to a white, the wines in this category feature the Gamay grape from Beaujolais.

    "text": "Even if you know how to shop the sales to get the best prices, clothes still likely amount to a sizable portion of your annual budget. If you want tips on finding the best prices, check out our post How to Buy the Clothes You Want at Clearance Prices. It just makes good financial sense to make your clothing last as long as possible.\nGet the most life from your wardrobe with the following regimen.\nUse good hangers. Solid wood hangers help keep the shoulders in your jackets or sweaters intact. In contrast, wire or thin plastic hangers cause those annoying and unsightly bumps in the shoulders, stretching and warping.\nDo your laundry inside out. Color loss occurs in clothing not just from washing. However, from the clothes rubbing against each other. Therefore, to prevent jeans, pants, or any other items from fading as quickly, turn them inside out before washing.\nStuff your shoes. Wad up a newspaper or packing paper and stuff them into your shoes and boots to help them keep their shape longer.\nWatch the fabric softener. Do not use fabric softener when washing workout or outdoor clothing designed to wick moisture. The fabric softener clogs the micropores in the clothing preventing them from wicking away sweat and moisture.\nHang an indoor clothesline. Even if the sun is not out, or you live in an apartment, you can still hang a short indoor clothesline to dry socks, t-shirts, bras, underwear, and other items. This prevents damage and fading done to gentler materials in the dryer. It also prevents your clothing from breaking down in the dryer. A clothesline also has the bonus of saving you some money on electricity.\nWash in cold water. To prevent the colors from fading from your favorite outfits, wash them in cold water and they will remain brighter much longer. Your clothes will get just as clean in cold water as in warm or hot water because it is the agitation of the washer, not the temperature of the water, which does the cleaning. It will also save you money on your energy bill because you will not have to run the water heater as much.\nBefore you leave, save money on laundry detergent and other household products, print or load coupons to a store loyalty program below.",

Apparently, this is their most innovative release in years so we'll probably have all 24, thanks.\nThis is likely to be you on 29th September, because that's the date they're due to be landing in the UK for £17.50 each.\nWhich shade is your fave?

But its hard to explain why, and it might not be even Windows 10’s fault.\nOn-screen keyboard doesn’t pop up automatically for Firefox, but does for Edge (Surface Pro 3 in tablet mode). One assumes because Edge is an Universal App?\nTraditional Chinese keyboard doesn’t display candidate list automatically; you have to press down-arrow every time to see the complete list. That is 1/4 to 1/3 more keystrokes per Chinese character!\nPressing the touchscreen for any action (e.g. close windows, ‘Ok’ button etc) has a minute but discernible lag, especially if you are used to an iPad. Two finger touchscreen scrolling is great though. Does this lie with Win10 or Surface Pro 3?\nOr maybe I’m just a grumpy old man set in my ways. I will seriously mourn the day Microsoft stops supporting Windows 7.\nIts finally finished. Windows Update has been calculating which updates to apply since 9am. So that’s more than 6 hours to calculate – now comes the actual update part.\nFair enough, this is a fresh reinstall of Windows 7 on a relic of a CPU: AMD Athlon x2. But its desktop class and not RAM constrained.\nI reckon Windows Update should be the real-world metric to assess how fast a system is. Sure, this way of measuring has a big flaw, since new updates are constantly available so updating at different times will produce different results. Regardless, it’ll still be a good-enough rough measure of how a system would perform for the average person using the PC in real life.",

The book features original commentary from designers, company founders, and pro skateboarders who have defined skateboarding’s look for generations.

Agile is efficient when the cost of making a change is lower than the cost of an iteration. In other words, your iterations have to be profitable (at least in aggregate.).\nDeploying software to a server costs almost nothing, so you can iterate every five minutes and make money. Except when you make a mistake and deploy something broken, which can cost you in damaged customer reputation. In many cases these are costs that can be absorbed, but fail too often and the product is doomed.\nAgile works by holding time and effort constant, but letting scope vary. That means using agile techniques to handle hardware projects where scope can't vary (like deploying routers to remote sites) can fail much more easily. If any component is delayed, the whole product is delayed, and other expenses rise: rescheduling installers often has a cascading effect on the rest of the project.",

The Alameda protest rally was held a day after hundreds of thousands of people participated in protests across the country following the decisions of a pair of grand juries not to hand down charges in the police killings of 18-year-old Michael Brown, of Ferguson, and 34-year-old Eric Garner, of New York.\nHere's an update of our popular Alameda development map, plus an update spreadsheet with more detail on development plans in Alameda.\nFuture residential development was on everyone’s mind Tuesday night as a growth-friendly City Council gave way to two new members who support a slower approach to development. But the old council members didn’t exit without leaving their mark on the city’s landscape.\nAlamedans will soon be asked to both conserve more water and pay more for what they use to help preserve the East Bay’s water supply in the face of a lingering drought. The East Bay Municipal Utility District board decided last week to ask customers to cut back their water use 15 percent from 2013 levels and to impose a 14 percent surcharge to cover the bill for water they’re buying from the federal government.\nThe holiday craze is at its peak: Traffic is a snarl, the sidewalks are packed with people, and many pockets are filled with crumpled to-do lists. This final weekend can test the strongest holiday spirit, but as the holiday stress crescendos, there’s one holiday tradition that can defuse my irritation instantly: Christmas trees.\nNews in brief(er): Alamedans are mourning the man struck and killed by an AC Transit bus last week … And an Alameda Girl Scout has earned her Gold Award.",

Explain to them that they will be painting two bottle caps and allowing it to dry while they create the hat and nose.\nCut out a small rectangle (1/2 inch). Then cut the rectangle in half to make the nose of the snowman.\nMake a small red and white Santa hat using red and white construction paper or felt. You can fold the top of the hat over so that it looks like the top of the hat is drooping down.\nWhen the paint is dried, glue both bottle caps together. You should glue the edges that will touch (the top and the bottom caps). Allow this to dry then take two small pieces of ‘googly’ eyes and glue them on the top bottle cap.\nAfter the glue is dried, then use a 6” piece of colored ribbon.\nWrap the 6” piece of ribbon around the two caps in the middle. Use extra glue to bond the middle since it is not so strong. Wrap around the middle several times until it looks like a scarf.

    "text": "For decades, the DSLR (digital SLR) has been the most notable choice for anybody who wants to take their photography to another level. Whether you’re a starter or an expert, a DSLR offers three attractive substances: manual settings, excellent display quality, and interchangeable lenses.\nThat isn’t quite so clearcut now though with the appearance of mirrorless camcorders, which are becoming increasingly more popular and luring many audience from DSLRs.\nA DSLR is still the least expensive way to get a camera with interchangeable lens and a viewfinder (you’ll find most entry-level mirrorless cams don’t have viewfinders) and, at the other end of the range, virtually all professional athletics, press, and wildlife professional photographers choose full-frame DSLRs over every other camera type.\nIf you’ve ever missed a shot because your telephone just didn’t concentrate fast enough, or your pictures are coming out blurry with your point-and-shoot model, step up to faster autofocus, more features, and higher quality results with an electronic SLR camera, or DSLR. Whether you’re a professional photographer looking to upgrade away from traditional SLR, or a novice who would like to capture family thoughts, vacations, and other incidents, Best Buy has all you need. Find a wide selection of cameras, lenses, and accessories from the top brands including Cannon, Nikon, Sony and more. Update to a DSLR offering the megapixels you will need for clear images, fast autofocus that freezes the action just where you want to buy, and other easy-to-use features that transform your picture taking. Plus, you can save money with the DSLR bargains you will discover here.",

I don't know if it has a hot water tank by-pass or if they put 6 Gal. of anti-freeze in the tank, I think there has to be a lot of unanswered questions, from visual indications it looks like it is worth the $6,500 he is asking. but I sure don't want to get in over my head with a lot of costly problems from the Casita just sitting idle four years, What are some of the things I should look for, if any one has any knowledge or experience or just suggestions along these lines I would certainly appreciate your thoughts.\ni got into trouble with that when i switched from a full size trucks---there is much crazy discussion about what i went thru but there is one good thread on tow weight in the real world that might help.\nDefinitely worth taking with you.\nGet under it, check for frame rust, cracks, etc.\nUsed glass trailers tend to see quickly if they are in good shape so don't ponder to long it it's a gem!\nSorry meant to type, IF its a gem!

    "text": "A new page has been turned in the Russian foreign exchange regulatory framework voting this week, and unsurprisingly it has been empty (again). The vote on the second reading of the Russian forex regulation bill has been postponed to autumn as ongoing geopolitical tensions are shifting priorities for the Russian Duma. However consultations of the Budget and Financial Markets Committee on the matter of prospective solutions of problems related to regulation of financial markets in Russia have taken place on the 15th of July.\nAccording to information exclusively obtained by Forex Magnates reporters from sources familiar with ongoing discussions there is now additional information about the regulatory framework proposed by the Bank of Russia.\nAccording to the Russian central bank there will be two categories of brokerages which are regulated. The first category entails prime brokers or market makers – those are accepting client money and are executing orders on the foreign exchange markets. The second category is allegedly called a “client” broker (which can be interpreted as a retail broker). Entities regulated under the second category are able to take client deposits, but are obligated by law to channel their order flow only to a regulated Russian prime broker.\nFor now there is no confirmation on the size of capital requirements for prime brokers and retail brokers. According to the information obtained by Forex Magnates no details have been revealed about regulation of introducing brokers which are not taking client deposits at this point in time.\nAnother key point which allegedly has been in the works is the process of client identification. According to current legislation confirmation of identity is only possible if a client presents his documents personally. Amendments to an existing law are in the works so that clients can identify themselves to brokerages by presenting a bank document confirming that the customer has been identified in person by a bank representative.\nThe news comes after a crackdown on offshore regulation in Russia has already been announced and in recent discussions of a draft anti-offshore bill, the Russian parliament has included Cyprus, the Netherlands and Luxembourg into its definition. The new law is aiming to crack down on tax evasion by Russian companies which are registered in tax heavens.\nAre the retail brokers allowed to make markets/run a book, or is this only for STP ?",

On the 3rd June 2015, Prof. Paul Smits, Dean Radboudumc, signed an agreement with Joan Guinovart, Director of IRB. This umbrella agreement paves the way for further strengthening of existing exchanges and exploring new opportunities for collaboration.\nHigh-quality research is a corner-stone of the Radboudumc covering research from molecule to man to population. It is within this academic hospital setting that RIMLS works to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and ultimately to develop tools for “Personalized Healthcare”. In his opening speech, Paul Smits noted the motto of IRB, ‘The medicine of the future starts here’. “I presume ‘here’, could also mean Nijmegen and not just Barcelona!” Present-day science tackles the most complex problems that usually cannot be solved by single researchers or even single institutions. Forming sustainable, interactive networks of scientists across international borders is indispensable for conceptual breakthroughs and translation of fundamental findings into clinical practice.\nConfirmed in a second contract signed by the directors of the programmes, from next year, IRB Masters students will be able to participate in our Molecular mechanisms of Disease (MMD) training. It is a huge boost that a third party institute has such confidence in the quality of our research and education. Furthermore, PhD students will visit be able to visit each other’s centers, and PIs will be invited for seminars. We will also look at the possibility of joint grant applications. Finally, we intend to invite IRB top researchers to apply for the RU Excellence program and/or Radboudumc Hypatia fellowship programme.\nThe visit of the IRB delegation was very positive, setting a concrete basis for further cooperation between our institutions.",

    "text": "Playgroups are important for variety of reasons, but the biggest one out of all the reasons is the role it plays in the development of a child. This prepares the child for school as basics about all the subjects taught in school are taken care of. It is also a place where children get an idea of their creativity and other interests. The importance of playgroup or preschool in a child’s life is many. We shall take a look at some of them.\nPlaygroups focus a lot on the development of a child, they use techniques enhanced specifically for this purpose. At such young age importance and focus should be given to the development of key physical features as well mental health too. Physical activities such as sports and games develop the muscles in the children’s body. At latter stages of preschool motor skills are given special importance; the stage by stage development of key aspects of a child plays a huge implication on the future growth and development of the child. So the importance of the kids’ playgroup cannot be neglected in developing a child to be a better and healthy human being for the future.\nThis is an important character for the success of an individual; team work is required for success in academics as well as work career. To hone these skills at an early age is an advantage for the child’s future. Playgroups focus on team work by making the children work in groups and also making them complete tasks and perform activities in a group. It also helps them build bonds which is an important aspect of growing up. This also builds up respects for one’s fellow human being.\nSince playgroups focus on the development of a child rather than mold them into something specific the curriculum is based on key aspects and characters that a child needs. This makes the learning experience fun and life lessons are learned. Everything is designed to keep the child interested, from furniture to the teaching techniques utilized everything is child centered.\nDiscipline is easy to enforce with strict rules and harsh punishments, but its relatively tough task to make children understand it and develop self discipline. This is where the brilliance of playgroups comes into play; since the environment is so child centered the children develop respect towards teachers and fellow students along with a sense of self control which leads to developing self discipline.",

Tom Carper (D-Del.), the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) of 2019 would reauthorize the program at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through 2024 to assist firms with rebuilding or retrofitting diesel engines. The objective is for those updated engines to be able to comply with pollution standards.\nThe Environment and Public Works panel advanced the measure to the floor of the Senate by voice vote. Carper, the panel’s ranking Democrat, had initially authored the bill more than a decade ago with former Ohio Sen. George Voinovich (R).\n“With today’s vote, we’re one step closer to making sure this bipartisan tradition, imagined and incepted by my dear friend Sen. Voinovich, will continue to boost economic growth and encourage environmental progress,” Carper added. Voinovich died in 2016.\nCo-sponsors of the bill include committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), as well as Republican Sens. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, along with Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.\nSenate floor managers have yet to schedule a floor vote for the bill. In March, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers unveiled their version.\n“This is a critical piece of legislation that helps address the climate crisis and makes our diesel cars and trucks more fuel efficient,” said Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, sponsoring the House version.\nEPA is tasked with distributing DERA grants.

And that makes sense, considering their locations across the region and notoriety among national touring acts. But in recent years, the dynamic has changed as more concert venues have opened in the suburbs. Since 2002, production company AEG Live has been luring fans to Verizon Theatre in Grand Prairie, and the Allen Event Center has made a commendable, if modest showing with concerts from Khalid and Meghan Trainor. Perhaps the most noteworthy is Live Nation’s Toyota Music Factory, the new amphitheater in Irving that has hosted dozens of high-profile shows including ZZ Top, Dave Chappelle and the Roots.

Ben’s blog on Making Leaf Mold - Gardener's Gold (2011) opened a lively dialog on leaves, to which I added my experiences in Using Leaves in the Vegetable Garden (2013). Our tips (plus many more) made it into the 7 Ways to Use Leaves in Your Garden video, which may be the best five minutes you will ever spend as you contemplate what to do with this year’s crop of leaves.\nNo, but then there is no such thing as a slug-deterring mulch. In slug-prone environments, it is better to forego mulching, and either compost your leaves or manage them in a separate pile to produce leaf mold. Then, use the compost or leaf mold as soil amendments. Should there be slug eggs present in the compost or leaf mold, allowing it to dry in the sun for a few days will kill most of them. This is also a great job for chickens, who happily remove slugs and other creatures from leaf piles.",

So, is there any provision where this switch could be registered on the dashboard through a type of 'evaluation license' in the meanwhile?\nHave you tried calling support and asking nicely? I am pretty sure they have authority to do something like that without too much trouble. Especially, if you can show them proof of order placed.\nJust add it to the network.

    "text": "Should We Choose A Separate Spring Mattress?\nThe independent Spring Mattress is an extension of the original spring mattress. It is specially built according to the new requirements of the sleeping mattress. What is “independent”? The springs are made into an independent and interlocking arrangement. Together, they form a bed net. Its function is to make each independent spring work equally well. It can support the operation independently and can be stretched and contracted. It is called an independent spring mattress.\nAdvantage 1: The inner spring of the independent spring mattress can be independently operated to support the force, and the zero-tone mode is turned on. The whole night will not interfere with the sleeping companion, ensuring comfortable comfort and sleep, which can effectively promote deep sleep and improve sleep quality.\nAdvantage 2: The independent spring mattresses are all made of high-quality spring steel wire winding around the city \"independent barrel shape\". They are sealed in the fiber bag after compression process, which can effectively avoid the noise caused by mold, insects and springs.\nAdvantage 3: Adapted to the human body fit curve flexible and flexible, can protect the ridges, let the spine maintain a natural straight posture, let the body muscles fully relax, relieve the human body pressure, reduce the number of turns in sleep, create a good sleeping environment.\nDisadvantage 1: The independent spring mattress needs to be flipped regularly. In order to ensure the balance of the force of each part of the mattress, the elasticity is good and the durability is durable. This is also its shortcoming. It requires manpower for long-term maintenance and brings unnecessary trouble to life. It is one of the reasons why modern young people are not keen on independent spring mattresses.\nDisadvantage 2: Independent spring mattresses need to be cleaned regularly to avoid moisture and moisture, so as not to damage the mattress. Long-term humidity may affect the life and performance of the spring. This is also a place where the individual pocket springs are insufficient.",

It previews OK, but when I export it to 1080p video, the background task just hangs. Judging by the progress bar, it may make it through a few frames, but nothing ever comes out, even if I leave it for a few hours. No music or other fancy stuff.\nSorry to hear you are having trouble. Let's perform a test on your system and see if we can zero in on the problem.. If you grab just 10 files and attempt the same (instead of the full 88 files), will the slide show then execute?\nIt seems to be random, or dependent on some unknown system process. When I originally built the show, it had 86 stills and exported OK. Then I added a video clip in the middle, and it started hanging at that point (judging by the progress bar). I removed the video, and changed a couple of the still images, and after that nothing worked. I did try a smaller subset at the time.\nStrangely, I just went and tried it, and it seems to be working again. Nothing has changed, other than rebooting the computer at some point in the interim (which I had also tried before).\nSo it now works with the video inserted in the middle?\nIt works with the full set of stills - I didn't try reinserting the video. I discovered the limitation, that you can't mute the background music during video clips, so I'm assembling the stills into a silent video and then finishing the edits in Lightworks.\nI can test reinserting the video later.\nReinserting the video now works too. Go figure.\nResetting preferences is definitely a bummer. It nukes LR in all sorts of subtle ways you've forgotten you set up.",

    "text": "As a part of each STEP module, the students learn about different health issues and translate materials that they can take back to their villages and use to educate others. Today one of the doctors from our clinic came to give a health lesson. We discussed how to know the difference between a common cold in children and pneumonia. Pneumonia is the number one killer of children in Papua New Guinea. However, there is a tendency for many villagers to go to the clinic and ask for “sut marasin” (an antibiotic shot) for any kind of illness that they have. Today the students learned that antibiotics should not be used to treat common colds, and also what signs to look for to know when a child really does need to go to the clinic and get medication.\nWe also learned about tuberculosis and the dangers of smoking. TB is a leading killer of adults in PNG, and so we learned about how it is spread, what the symptoms are and how it can be treated. Smoking is also very common in PNG, and there are common misconceptions. For example, many people believe that only imported, packaged cigarettes will mess up your body, and that the roll-your-own variety have no health consequences.\nFinally, we spent some time talking about cholera. Just this year, Papua New Guinea experienced its first cholera outbreak. It started near a port city and is slowly making inroads to other parts of the country. The students were glad to learn that it is a preventable disease and what steps they could take to protect themselves and their communities.",

IN comparison, CD32 is a 40 kD glycoprotein that acts as a low affinity receptor for IgG (also known as Fc gamma RII), and mediates several functions including endocytosis, activation of secretion, cytotoxicity and immunomodulation. CD32 is expressed by B cells, monocytes, granulocytes and platelets. Further, CD32 is involved in the phagocytosis of immune complexes, the regulation of antibody production by B-cells, and variations of the CD32 gene may increase vulnerability to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Which is the first major sell off I have seen in a while.\nWith the situation over at Greece, and from what I understand a few other potential European countries, a “dash of shorts spice” was thrown into the markets.\nOver the past few years, most short-term selloffs turned out to be a buying opportunity, but as they say hindsight is 20/20 vision.\nAs one who got burnt going short on the indices I am trying to be a bit more careful.\nIn order for the Russell to confirm a sell signal based on the weekly chart, I need to see a daily close below 1244. Yesterday was VERY close to it but still closed above it.\nI think that a close below 1244 can trigger 1089 over the next few weeks/months.\nNot an easy scenario to trade with as the memories of short attempts in the past few years not turning into much to say the least….\nOne way one can trade this is by using straight futures and going short on close below 1244. The risk on this one would be quite high as one would need to use a stop above 1280 or maybe even past the recent high above 1292.\nAnother way to go about it (and one can choose stock index of their choice) is to buy a vertical put spread, where you buy a closer to the money put and sell a further out of the money put.\nAs always, certain strategies may be more appropriate for certain traders, depending on their experience, market outlook and risk capital.",

The reaction system (So, SoH+, SoH22+, Sc' ScH+, ScH22+) comprising three protolytic forms in both open and closed configuration, is characterized by four protolytic equilibrium constants and six photochemical quantum yields of ring closing and ring opening. The absorption spectra, conductivity, and effective photochemical quantum yields were measured in acetonitrile as functions of solvent acidity varied by addition of trifluoroacetic acid and triethylamine and characterized by an effective pHnon-aq. Based on the derivation of a rigorous method for assessing the individual quantum yields of ring closure and ring opening of the six species, it was shown that it is specifically the second protonation step that is responsible for a more than 10-fold increase in the quantum yield of ring closure.",

Kate Gould of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, an expert on the Middle East policy, explains why now is the time for supporters of peace and diplomacy to reassert what the deal the Obama administration struck with Iran has accomplished.\nAs a result of the deal, there have already been more conversations between the U.S. and Iran over other regional conflicts, which is tremendously significant. Now that this diplomatic channel is wider, the U.S. should hold up its end of the bargain and lift more of the economic sanctions against Iran, which can only be done by Congress, Gould says.\nOn this issue, it matters who is in the White House – Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said ripping up the Iran deal would be among his first actions if he is president – and it matters how much citizen pressure in support of continued diplomacy with Iran is felt by Congress.",

Getting the best bang for your buck is not only welcomed in the process but strongly desired. Here are a few party rentals that will you keep your costs low and rental value high!\nTransform old items into party decorations with a little elbow grease and creativity. Rent basic tables and tablecloths, and then let your imagination fly! Condiment jars or glasses serve as great makeshift candle holders, and empty wine bottles can always be turned into flower vases. Large tin buckets can be used as ice chests for beverages and old chalkboards can serve as rustic wedding decor. Be creative with unused items around your house and it can help you save money on your special day!\nA prudent way to stick to a food budget is to cook your own and rent chafing dishes to keep your food well-heated throughout your event. Sterno candles can keep your food fresh and warm for up to four hours at a time.\nIf you’re on a tight budget, you may not have the funds to hire servers for your party. An alternative solution is to set up fun concession stands such as a popcorn machine or a chocolate fountain. These concessions are not only a perfect addition to your party, but also a great way to keep your guests entertained without the additional cost of a server.\nStaying within budget can be difficult when planning a party but with some creative thinking and research, you can organize rentals that provide the best bang for your buck.

Like the above case, the arguments other than the filename hand main.\nFor instance, assume we create args.egi.\nThen, executing the following commands, you can find the arguments are given for main as $args.\nTo do more complicated I/O tasks, we can use do expressions, which is similar to the let and letrec expressions. The feature of the do expressions is serial execution. If you know Haskell, you probably notice that it is the same with the do expressions in Haskell. Recall many I/O functions have no return values. In such cases, we can omit to write a variable.\nThen, execute it as follow.\nWhen the code is executed, (write \"args: \"), (read-line) and (write input) are executed in the order.\nThere are several samples in the directory sample/io/.

Making The Future For Singapore, which is a compilation of three lectures he delivered between September and November last year.\nMr Lim said that while thinking about the lectures, he came to the conclusion that to succeed and avoid \"social decay\", Singaporeans needed to think about the kind of society they aspired to be.\n\"You might not agree with me or my conclusions but my real desire is to get Singaporeans talking and debating,\" he said.\nThe aim of the lectures and the new book was simply \"to get Singaporeans to think\", he added.\n\"It is about thinking why we do things. We might all stand on the left when on the escalators, but are we doing it because we are afraid of being punished, or do we do it because we want to make moving easier for others,\" Mr Lim said.\nHe urged Singaporeans to create a gracious society and to build a culture of innovation, excellence and outwardness.\nEducation Minister Ong Ye Kung, who helped launch the book at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said Mr Lim was his mentor.\n\"Everywhere I look in public service, Mr Lim has left an indelible mark,\" Mr Ong said.\nMr Janadas Devan, director of the Institute of Policy Studies, said the lectures by Mr Lim last year had the highest number of attendees among all lectures delivered by S R Nathan Fellows.",

These workshops bring together diverse “dream teams” of leading professionals, graduate students, and undergraduates, in a truly cooperative, intensive, and substantive effort to advance the state of the science.\nThese workshops constitute a continuation of the well known Johns Hopkins University summer workshops, and encompasses all areas of human language technology including automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, topic detection and tracking, information retrieval and extraction, summarization and question answering, and certain related areas of computer vision, including image understanding and visual scene analysis. These fields share many important algorithmic and statistical approaches, allowing cross-fertilization. Machine learning challenges that arise from these areas are of fundamental scientific interest, and are shared with many other fields of science and engineering, such as medical-/bio-informatics and social network analysis.\nThe Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) has 20 years of experience with organizing workshops of this kind. JHU will therefore act as an anchor for these workshops, but the actual host institution will rotate from year to year in order to ensure wider community ownership and engagement, and to distribute the organizational burden more widely. The 2014 workshop was hosted at Charles University in Prague, the 2015 workshop was hosted at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, will be the site of the 2016 workshop.",

Warm sesame bread joins the party, a total lunchtime treat.\nInviting doorways sweeten the air with a stew of dates, figs and cinnamon gently simmering lamb into tender obedience. Fetid whiffs of rotting rubbish, poor drainage and fish carcasses are partly masked by freshly popped corn and street vendors conjuring candy floss. Lights above the labyrinth of narrow crooked passages fade in and out to the tune of power surges. Old men sit and watch children chase each other at warp speed, adults enjoy an evening passeggiata and satisfy their sweet fix with nutella crepes.\nKnown as the Windy City, a trip to Essaouira is a mecca for kitesurfers (our primary motivation) and windsurfers (Planet Kitesurf Holidays). A shared space for all including camels and horses, a wide sandy bay stretched out like a lazy dog with orange blush sunsets silhouetting late afternoon surfers. Oversized studded wooden doors fill arches on antiquity, concealing intricately tiled courtyards with triple heighted spaces, proud palm trees and elegant Islamic architecture charmed by colonial furnishings such as Villa de L’O and Heure Bleue.\nPulling focus, Essaouira’s sophistication lies in its imperfect beauty, a desire not to try and impress but simply be.

    "text": "A mother of four is facing deportation to her native South Africa over a mix-up in her UK visa application.\nAlison Hawkins, who has lived in the UK for 13 years with British husband Wayne and their children aged between 21 and 14, tried to renew her visa in July. But she has now received notification that her application has been turned down because she had not paid the new £500 NHS surcharge.\nMrs Hawkins, who had discretionary leave to remain in the UK and intended to apply for citizenship, said she did not receive the letter from immigration authorities relating to the charge.\nShe had already paid more than £600 applying for her visa and must now resubmit her application or face being deported. She has also been told she cannot work in the UK as her discretionary leave to remain was not renewed. In addition, she must also wait for 10 years before applying for British citizenship, rather than the previous two years.\nMrs Hawkins, who lives in Distington, Cumbria, told the Workington Times and Star: “I just want a fair chance. I have paid all my taxes and national insurance. I have never claimed any benefits even though my visa allowed me to do so.\nShe said she had not received the letter relating to the NHS charge. She is also waiting for the authorities to return her certificate which proves she speaks English, which she needs to resubmit her visa application.\nIf Mrs Hawkins is forced to leave the UK, she will not be allowed to return for a year and if she is deported, she faces a 10-year wait before she can reapply for a visa. The Hawkins family have contacted their MP, Jamie Reed, over the issue and their eldest daughter Kimberley has started an online petition in support of her mother.",

    "text": "One of the most frustrating aspects of working in advertising is the fact that people find us intrusive and sometimes even detrimental to their content. And most of the time… we can’t say they’re entirely wrong. We’re probably the only industry in the world that people invent technologies to avoid.\nThe industry is increasingly questioning what brands actually add to people’s lives. A brand is more than a product. You can get rid of a product, but you can’t get rid of a brand (unless you have good lawyers).\nRecently, Hubert Reeves reminded us that we’re at a crossroads. The world doesn’t need more products. The saying less is more has never been more timely and relevant. We don’t need another product, we need better brands.\nWhat value are we adding when we use ads to help sell disposable products? What value are we adding when we refresh logos for products who really need to refresh their place in the world?\nWe all have the tendency to drink our own Kool-Aid and think consumers will be interested in our latest content pieces. But most people don’t have the time, interest or desire to engage with brand content. What actually interests them is how a brand can add value to their life.\nGiven that new, human-centered definition, some brands have the potential to make a difference in our world like never before, sometimes much faster and more effectively than our own governments.\nThese are the brands that truly care about the well-being of the people who consume them because they are aware of their social, cultural, environmental and political impact. These brands are finding new ways to be relevant, useful and entertaining. They are creating engaging ecosystems, based on experiences that welcome and nurture consumer relationships.\nWe need to recognize those brands more often and mirror their actions. To do so, I’m putting together a list of brands who, in my humble opinion, understand how to make a real difference in people’s lives.\nWarning: cheesy video alert. Nonetheless, they embedded good into the product.",

    "text": "Can Medical Marijuana Actually Assist With Rough Hangovers?\nSpending a night out with your friends is always a good time, but the morning after is not always a bed of roses. Too often, going hard at the club or the bar will result in a massive headache and upset stomach the next day. However, what if there was a way to reduce the effects of a hangover? While there are plenty of products on the market today, one might be the best of them all: medical cannabis. Let’s see what discoveries are being made about this potential cure.\nBefore we can decide if weed can cure this ailment, we first have to understand how it works. After a hard night of drinking, your body requires two things to feel refreshed and get back to normal. First, you need to rehydrate as alcohol saps your body of water. Second, you have to flush all of the toxic chemicals out of your system. Until both of those things happen, you won’t be rid of your hangover.\nWell, it should be clear that smoking a joint will not rehydrate your cells, nor will it expunge the alcohol from your body. So why would it ever be considered a hangover cure? Well, two reasons. First, it helps you feel better, so you are not in as much pain (particularly in your head). Second, it can alleviate your nausea and help you eat and drink. Since water is necessary to beat your hangover, this can be a game changer.\nIf you want the ultimate in convenience, then you should look into getting your weed delivered. After a night of partying, you won’t have the energy or stamina to go to the nearest dispensary. Instead, look for marijuana delivery near me and hit them up for some sweet relief.\nOverall, weed won’t cure your hangover, but it will make it a lot more tolerable. The only thing to remember is to smoke a little bit; it’s never a good idea to be hungover and high.\nWhat Is the Connection Between Ethics and Social Media?",

I prayed for Divine help and received a deep connection to universal love, to my friend, and a knowing that her spirit lived on.\nOpening or balancing your Crown Chakra can bring a profound awakening, a connection to your spiritual nature as well as to cosmic consciousness.\nFree Chakra Energy Diet menu plans for all the chakras are available at www.theChakras.org.\nARE FOODS AFFECTING YOUR ENERGY FLOW?\nCan what you eat disturb your energy flow? Absolutely. In other posts, I’ve listed foods that specifically energize each chakra. But, in general, it’s best to avoid GMO’s, genetically-modified crops such as the corn and soy found in most commercial products. Buying organic products, labeled “non-GMO,” can save you from many health issues that are just coming to light through independent research about Monsanto’s RoundUp and RoundUp-ready, genetically-engineered crops.\nGiven as a token of love on Valentine’s Day, chocolate even loves us back – providing beneficial nutrients like Iron, Calcium, Potassium and Magnesium in addition to vitamins A, E and other antioxidants, dispelling our bad moods and literally providing food for thought by renewing our spirits and launching our meditations. It even helps open the Third Eye chakra, for greater intuition and psychic power. And it’s great to meditate with a piece, see… http://www.squidoo.com/Chocolate-Therapy.",

In most cases, they are kittens that are too young to be adopted – and some so young that they need to be bottle-fed.\nExperience the joy of having a kitten without the cost and time commitment of owning one. The Placer SPCA has already received more than 350 kittens. That number is expected to increase dramatically in the months leading up to October, when kitten season tends to slow down.\nThe Placer SPCA offers free foster classes to anyone interesting in becoming a foster parent. If you would like to attend their upcoming class, please register at www.placerspca.org/foster.\nWHEN: Friday, July 11 from 2 – 4 p.m.\nBlog post information courtesy of Placer SPCA.",

They will also gleefully inform you that the risks in some cases far outweigh the potential, especially if they are among the more cautious investors in the industry. Those who have made their fortunes in real estate however will tell you that investing in real estate is worth every ounce of risk when you manage to work through the rough patches and find your way to real estate investing fortunes.\nCommercial real estate investing is a bit of a different animal than traditional residential real estate that many of us are more familiar or comfortable with. You will need to do a lot of research before jumping in with both feet with this particular sort of real estate investment. Commercial real estate investments can take on many forms. From strip malls and outright shopping malls to business and industrial complexes to sky scrapers and high rise condos you will find all manner of commercial real estate interests. Whether your interests lie in business or personal types of commercial real estate there are significant profits that stand to be made.\nUnfortunately, beginners often find the path to commercial real estate investing laden with thorns. You will need a massive contribution to fund your commercial real estate pursuits and it is probably best if you can find a group of investors in order to share some of the risks. Real estate, in and of itself, is a high-risk venture. Commercial real estate bears a little more of the risks in the beginning however once you're established and people, particularly investors, know your name you will find that path to real estate wealth is much easier obtained through commercial real estate, if you play your cards right than many other types of real estate investing.",

This is the first wearable OTC ECG device to date.\nThe guts of the watch have been upgraded with an S4 system-on-chip, a new accelerometer for more accurate activity tracking, and a 64-bit dual-core processor that is twice as fast as the last generation. The microphone and speaker are improved as well and the digital crown now has haptic feedback. Lastly the old bands still work on the Series 4 Watch ($399-$499).",

    "text": "At a high level of abstraction, a digital or computer file is a stored segment or block of information that is available to a computer program. Files are so named because they are the counterparts of the paper documents traditionally kept in file folders, usually stored in a file cabinet. Computer operating systems consider files as a sequence of bytes, while application software interprets the binary data as, say, text characters, image pixels, or audio samples.\nThis term is comparable to the term file as defined in Introduction and Supporting Materials from PREMIS Data Dictionary (p. 7): \"A file is a named and ordered sequence of bytes that is known by an operating system. A file can be zero or more bytes and has a file format, access permissions, and file system characteristics such as size and last modification date . . . . Files can be read, written, and copied. Files have names and formats.\"\nAlthough this high-level meaning is valid for the Federal Agencies Digitization Initiative, our definition also calls attention to the digital file in relationship to the digital package and the digital package part. Take, for example, the case of a digitally reformatted book or 78 rpm phonodisc. The digital package includes all of the files pertaining to the digitized book or phonodisc. Most reformatting programs will create a set of versioned digital files--perhaps an archival master, a production master, and multiple derivative files--for each book page or disc side (digital item parts). Thus page 3 or side B may be represented by three or four files that meet a variety of objectives.",

    "text": "There is actually a great deal of crossover between the two words and the items they represent, meaning the terms can be used interchangeably a lot of the time. This arises due to the different ways the words are used as nouns or verbs and, in relation to products such as screws, nails, nuts/bolts etc, difficulties arise unless the word ‘fixing’ is ONLY used as a verb.\nAs always, when there is confusion like this, the best place to head for is the dictionary to get a proper definition. But don’t worry, we have done the research for you!\nFor example, if a joist is securely nailed into a joist hanger, with the use of extra straps for lateral restraint purposes, ‘fixings’ refers to the entire system, inclusive of all straps and connectors. The ‘fasteners’ in this context are the nails. A further example: if a rafter is attached to a wall plate using nails, the ‘fastener’ would be the nails and the ‘fixing’ the nails centres.\nIn most cases, uses the terms interchangeably is not a major issue and you will generally be understood either way. Our original question, about why we are not called BS Fasteners, is that we supply such a wide range of products that it makes more sense to refer to the entire systems we supply rather than individual items. Also, BS Fixings rolls off the tongue much nicer in our opinion!\nWhatever you need to fix, use our fasteners to fix it. We have got everything you could ever require and, if you can’t see it right away, then our expert team will source it for you to ensure that your project can be completed to the most professional standard.",

Even though you try very hard, the progress you make is always little by little. It is not like going out in a shower in which you know when you get wet. In a fog, you do not know you are getting wet, but as you keep walking you get wet little by little. If your mind has ideas of progress, you may say, \"Oh, this pace is terrible!\" But actually it is not. When you get wet in a fog it is very difficult to dry yourself. So there is no need to worry about progress. It is like studying a foreign language; you cannot do it all of a sudden, but by repeating it over and over you will master it. This is the Soto way of practice. We can say either that we make progress little by little, or that we do not even expect to make progress. Just to be sincere and make our full effort in each moment is enough. There is no Nirvana outside our practice.\nIf you say, \"I breathe.\", the \"I\" is extra.\nSleeping is the best meditation.\n'cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go\"\nand fill your heart with the love of friendly family.\nNo warranties, expressed or implied; ymmv.",

The whole pods can be added to dishes, or the seeds can be extracted and either added whole or ground. When using cardamom to flavour curries, lightly crush the whole pod and it to the dish, and remember to use the whole pods for garnishing to add that dash of green. But remember to use it sparingly, as a little cardamom goes a long way.\nCombating Cold and Flu: If you are suffering from a flu, black cardamoms form the perfect soother. Just steep some pods in water with honey and it will relieve you effectively.\nAids Digestion: Its strong aroma helps in activating our taste and sensory elements, thereby aiding digestion. So, after a heavy meal keep some cardamoms by your side.\nMouth freshener: The floral and sweet aroma of cardamoms make it a natural breath freshener and helps promote oral hygiene.\nLowers high blood pressure: According to Ayurveda a concoction of a teaspoon coriander and one pinch of cardamom mixed with 1 cup of freshly squeezed peach juice can help bring down high blood pressure. Therefore, it is known to be a heart-friendly spice.\nSecret to good health: The Chinese believe drinking cardamom tea helps flushing out the toxins and keeps you healthy longer.\nSo, add a cardamom to your daily cup of tea, coffee, milk or a glass of warm water and honey, along with adding it to your sweet dishes and savoury ones alike, to make the most of this wonderful spice.",

According to an article on TwinCities.com, Minnesotans are not only becoming more energy conscious, but more pocketbook conscious in this time of economic downturn.\nPeople are making changes to their homes by using energy-efficient products, adding insulation, and adjusting thermostats. They’re also learning that doing these things save money in the long run, as does unplugging things not in use, not leaving lights on, and keeping heating and cooling system usage as low as possible.\nAccording to the same article, Xcel’s energy plants have actually been able to decrease their energy production by 6% per customer, which is a gigantic step in the right direction.\nTo read the full article, visit TwinCities.com.",

Additionally, she serves as a thought-partner to the executive team to define, refine and communicate the Ironwood story.\nAs Ironwood kicked off 2016, the company had outgrown its science-heavy, startup-focused story frame and needed to better emphasize the unmet needs it was serving and the significant commercial capabilities it was leveraging to do so, including its award-winning marketing team and national sales force. Working closely with the CEO and the executive team, Morrison co-led the process of reframing Ironwood’s story as a commercial biotechnology company, advancing its key franchises in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation/chronic idiopathic constipation, refractory GERD and vascular/fibrotic disease.\nThe revised messaging and related materials debuted at the J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference in January 2016—biotech’s largest investor conference—and feedback from investors, analysts and Ironwood’s Board of Directors was positive. Moreover, these key messages carried through positively in the subsequent media placements—including the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Boston Globe, and myriad trade publications, including a cover story in Life Science Leader—that Ironwood secured. Outreach around this effort has garnered nearly 250 million impressions year-to-date.",

Others simply hide in plain sight.\nResearchers studied how jumping spiders use mimicry to disguise themselves as ants. While most animals mimic by altering their physical appearance, spiders do it by changing how they move.\nThat's because spiders are a more sought-after food than ants. But many of their predators — like some toads, lizards and wasps — have slow visual systems, so these spiders will move like ants to throw off attackers.\nThe arachnids' motions are pretty sophisticated, too. They will replicate winding movements like ants do when they're following pheromone trails.\nThey can even sell their act while standing still. When predators are around, they'll pick up their front two legs and wave them like antennae.",

This is a record that will never leave my collection. Absolute monster.\nDARK FORCES, arguably the best track off Slam's debut album, gets the remix treatment here, and Claude Young is on the job for a harder mix, which doesn't differ greatly melodically, but messes around with the percussion some and adds an interesting interlude. Kenny Larkin also plays with the rhythms some while maintaining the original riff, though the track shifts into its own being 1/3 of the way through. With the b-sides, \"Sick Organ\" offers an off-kilter tech track with plenty of angular melodies to keep the ears intrigued, while \"Plastic Jazz\" goes on a shiny tech-house kick. Not much jazz, but plenty of Detroitian groove.\nOnce you have heard Dark Forces you won't forget it. It's a deep track that is very of the period and hasn't aged the best but it never fails to bring back memories.

These cat converters can fail by becoming clogged, or if the engine has bad exhaust valves or the plugs fail, causing unburned fuel to overheat the converter. Mettam's Mufflers can resolve these issues with your Armadale HONDA by replacing your damaged or clogged cat converter with a standard or hi-flow cat converter in under 1 hour.\nTwo examples of accessories that Mettam's Muffler's can provide to your Armadale HONDA are stainless steel mufflers and stainless steel tips and chrome ends. These products can add a distinct sound and look to every car.\nMettam's Mufflers are located in three convenient locations and can fit your Armadale HONDA's Performance Exhaust Systems.",

    "text": "The French Senate, in partnership with ESA, is holding a colloquium on the subject of \"Satellites and Bridging the Digital Divide\". The gathering will evaluate the potential role of satellite systems in achieving nationwide digital access. European attempts to date to achieve that goal will also be assessed.Bridging the digital divide is a challenge that has to be addressed for the future development of Europe's regions. For citizens isolated by natural obstacles, those living in scattered rural communities or on the outlying periphery of the European Union, there has been no commercially-viable solution to bring them online. Moreover, the arrival of ten new EU member countries will perhaps increase the current inequality of digital access.\nThe colloquium will address the question of: \"Can space-based infrastructures provide the most appropriate solution to narrow the gap?\" Terrestrial infrastructures, for example, are affected by population density or low-level economic activity. Satellite systems, however, guarantee uniform coverage over a given area; within this area, all potential users enjoy the same access to services and the same quality of service. TV broadcasting is a practical illustration of this.\nIt is therefore important to determine if the satellite option can provide a technically appropriate response. Because most digitally-deprived localities tend also to be the least densely populated issues related to how this should be financed become highly relevant. However, it remains to be seen if a third component needs to be added to European strategy for space (the others are Galileo and GMES) to deal effectively with issues surrounding the digital divide. The colloquium should clarify many of these questions.\nThe colloquium will be on 22 January 2004 at the French Senate (Palais du Luxembourg) in Paris France.",

Thanks to the company’s busy bookkeepers, it found clever ways of actually getting a federal income tax rebate of $129 million, which essentially means Uncle Sam dropped a maraschino cherry on top of Amazon’s massive cash slushie.\nMeanwhile, Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon who once earned more on his lunch break than some countries earn in months, has been crowned the wealthiest person on the planet. Last year, his net worth smashed $150 billion – some $50 billion more than Microsoft’s CEO runner-up Bill Gates.\nSo, as average Americans prepare for the annual ritual of mailing their tax returns by the April 15 deadline, many do so in the knowledge that they will owe Uncle Sam some money. Behemoth companies like Amazon, however, rarely have such worries. They have the means to avoid paying what many believe are their rightful dues. This was not the way things were supposed to be.\nIn 2017, Donald Trump, in one of his first acts as president, signed the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.\nProponents of the legislation, underestimating the pervasive allure of greed, believed this reduction would make corporations more willing to crack open their purses and contribute their fair share to the tax load. Obviously, the plan backfired.\nThe new tax law “failed to broaden the tax base or close a slew of tax loopholes that allow profitable companies to routinely avoid paying federal and state income taxes on almost half of their profits,”according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP).",

They were then asked to find a lighting item that they would like to buy from the website.\nUsers were immediately drawn to the large panel in the central section of the homepage. Some used this area as general navigation and missed the primary navigation at the top of the page. The effect of this was that these users missed some of the lighting products that were available to them, because this graphic was targeted to a certain type of product.\nThere was a mix of how users chose to navigate from the home page. There was a split between users clicking on to the main graphic, the primary navigation and the search box. When conducting a general search from the site search box, one user started typing in the search term ‘lights’. A drop down list of search suggestions appear in the search box but they were rather abstract for this particular user who chose ‘lights fantastic’ and was confused by the wording displayed to him.\nUsers did not play with the filters on the left hand side of the page. For lighting, users were more interested in the style of the item and were drawn to each product photograph to make their decision. Users looked at the brand names underneath the photographs and spent more time looking at the brands that they failed to recognise.\nOnce a user had found a product that they wanted to purchase they were re-directed to the retailer’s website. This was very slow for some users and they abandoned their journey. Users were shown a re-direction page that contained information regarding why they should shop with mydeco.com. Users stared at one bullet point that said ‘shop in your jimjams’.

    "text": "Hi, my name is Imogen and I am age 21 and live in York, England. I started Upside Down Chronicles in 2014 to have a dedicated place for my writing. This blog has gone through many transformations as my life has. At first this blog was a place to discuss issues relating to sight loss and the adventures of my assistance dog and I as we explored the world. However, In 2014 after many years of struggling with mental ill health I was admitted to a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service inpatient unit for treatment. I spent a year in two children’s psychiatric units in which I rekindled my love for creativity. I wrote about my time in CAMHS inpatient care on this blog, to try and bring insight into the lives of so many young people who are in psychiatric units today. Creativity saved my life, and I am determined to bring it into the lives of other young people like me.\nThese days this blog is mostly a resource of information and personal experience of mental illness. I hope that by reading my posts people can feel slightly less alone. I am registered blind, and my posts often link into disability more generally as well as tying into my work as an arts facilitator and artist.\nI am a trained Arts Award Adviser and run arts workshops and groups for people of all ages and abilities. These workshops are individually planned to the needs of the participants. So far I have done everything from using Makkaton to sign ‘The Gruffalo’, all the way to creating spoken word poetry.\nMy own art form mostly revolves around the written word. I perform my own spoken word poetry at local gigs and have been featured at York Literature Festival and York Disability Pride. I also draw cartoon mice which explain various aspects of mental illness, recovery and disability and share them on Instagram. I am currently working as Artist in Residence at York Explore Libraries and Archives as well as volunteering as an arts group assistant at York Mind.",

Guests had choices of Pitar wines and Mill Street Beer along with hors d’oeuvres like smoked Gouda grilled cheese sandwiches from Lakeview Restaurant and Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped dates) from Samuel J Moore.\nThe various rooms of the Campbell House housed different theatre companies who performed teasers from their upcoming SummerWorks shows or created one-of-a kind pieces just for the Soirée. Magician Joe Culpepper, (Show and Tell Alexander Bell) delighted guests with his carnation magic trick.\nJani Lauzon (A Side of Dreams) showed guests how to make their own dreamcatchers, which allows good dreams to fall through the centre and nightmares to be caught in the web. In the piece ‘Four Words’, SummerWorks Artist-In-Residence and host of CBC Radio’s Definitely Not the Opera, Sook-Yin Lee (How Can I Forget) along with Adam Litovitz, Max Chandler, Stephanie Southmayd and Alice Lundy, encouraged the crowd to join them in creating a poem using only four words at a time. The witty poems were then sold for $4.00 or auctioned off to the highest bidder, much to the amusement of the crowd.\nOne highlight was the comedic libretto excerpt from Paradises Lost which follows the 200 year journey of the starship Discovery to colonize a new uninhabited planet.\nBluemouth Inc. staged a game of strip poker where participants had to reveal a truthful incident from their lives. And, some clothes did come off!\nAfter the VIP event, the doors were opened to the general public for the Launch Party with more treats, wines, live performances and music.",

Diogo then places a kiss on her cheek.\nBoth he and Nicole wanted Isadora to play a big role in their wedding ceremony, and since the 6-year-old is at that age where fantasizing about being a bride or a princess is cool, this was truly a dream come true.\nIsadora always hoped that Diogo and her mom Nicole would get married someday.\nNow this triad of love is officially a family, though it’s obvious from this photo that they were already so.",

Hopefully it'll work fine on lower spec devices, but of course the higher the spec the better.\nStill a bit of work to do before I start a Beta, but it shouldn't be too far away.\nLooking good! I can't wait!\n:DD I really really can't wait! Ahhh! I totally love this game! ^___^ Good job, guys!\nAwesome.

    "text": "The MCU is a funny beast. Despite the titling, it's now become pretty difficult to isolate any single film as standalone - in my view they should have just stopped messing around and named this film MCU 13. That's not to say the labouring of the MCU is a bad thing; on the contrary really since Civil War really is one of the best film to have come out of the franchise so far. And yes, that includes Assemble.\nDespite being the easiest way to explain, it would be unfair to directly compare it to that the lynch pin movie of 2012. CW is mature, grown up, relying less on gimmicks and set pieces. There's more to the film than just the action and fan service. And yes, it does make you think (well, kind of). All of the characters come into their own (another reason why calling this a Captain America film could be seen as odd), and have been given more than enough potential to grow even more.\nThe downsides include some shoddy filming, especially during the fight scenes. Overall though the movie does get away with it, as it injects the blue, red and gold blurs into your eyeballs.\nI won't go on because it'll just end up being gush. Needless to say Civil War is a great film and very much recommended.",

The experiments include a predesigned W8x10 beam with limited existing damage subject to a realistic parametric fire curve with a decay phase, and two W12x26 beams – one bare steel and one insulated with a spray on fire resistant material - designed and tested with an E119 standard fire curve. The complete design and record of the tests are provided, including data on specimen temperatures and deflections.SAFIR 2016 was used to model the systems thermal and structural behavior at various levels of intensity. 2D beam, 3D beam, and 3D shell models were created to test the level of accuracy and predictability of the models. The 2D structural models were proven to be incapable of predicting accurate behavior of a composite system. MATLAB 2015 was used to verify temperature predictions using a three lumped mass calculation approach, and was shown to equal or exceed the performance of the thermal finite element models.A parametric study was conducted using the results from the two W12x26 test beams. The lengths of these beams were extended from the 11’-0” able to be accommodated in the furnace out to 15-0”’, 20’-0”, 25’-0”, and 30’-0” to study how the realistic lengths change the behavior of the tests. Validated SAFIR 3D beam and shell models were used to predict behavior, and show the differences and values between the two types of models.\nKordosky, Amy, \"Experimental and Computational Investigation of Composite Beam Response to Fire\" (2017).

Are there any cuts, holes or cracks? You need to go through every part of the motorcycle to check for any signs of damage. Also, check for rust at the bar ends and fuel tanks.\nCheck if the tires are in good condition. You also need to check that if the bike is complete with two mudguards, pegs and pillion seats.\nSee if the engine is clean and not covered in grease and oil. You can also remove the seat and check for the tools.\nCheck if the bike’s side and center stand are in good condition. Also, don’t forget to look for scouring on brake discs.\nThe electrical harness must be retained and there should not be any loose wires. There should not be any fluid or oil on the forks.\nOnce you are done looking and checking for most of the parts, you need to check how the motorcycle is working. Start by grabbing the exhaust when cold and give it a little shake. See if it squeak or rattles.\nSit on the motorcycle and see how comfortable it is. Check if the seat is not loose and shaggy.\nCheck if the engine is in good condition. The engine must start easily and see if it blows any smoke.\nGo for a short drive and check if the brakes work Also, check if all the controls are easy to use.\nIf there is any problem that you find out in the motorcycle, then see how can it be fixed and how much will it cost you.

    "text": "The mortgage market this past week resulted in higher interest rates for those looking for new homes or refinancing their existing homes. The reasons behind this are pure speculation: The Federal Reserve may stop the bond buying program because new unemployment claims hit a low not seen in six years.\nFor several weeks, there has been ongoing speculation the Fed would stop the QE program they have been running to keep interest rates low. However, the markets are getting increasingly nervous as economic news continues to be positive. However, it is important to note that there is a significant chance the bond buying program will most likely not come to a screeching halt. Instead, the Fed will most likely taper this program off to ensure the markets do not over-react (much like what they are doing now).\nNone of these reports, outside of perhaps the Fed minutes, will drive the market too much in one direction or another. However, there is little doubt that as more economic data comes in that is positive, we will continue to see rates rising.\nMany who are refinancing an existing property or financing a new home often struggle with whether or not to lock in their interest rates at the time of their application. Keep in mind that locking a rate in often means paying extra points or paying a small fee upfront. However, the fee that you might incur could be worthwhile over the life of your loan.\nWhether you are purchasing a home or you are consider a refinance on your existing home, the time may be running short to lock in lower rates. Contact Core Mortgage Financial today and let us help you evaluate whether or not this is the right time for you to consider locking a rate in at today’s lower rates. Keep in mind, the markets are all indicating higher long-term interest rates so time may be running out.",

Being exercise avoiders and salad dodgers for quite some time now, it’s a title which we went into without really knowing what to expect, but we’ve come away fairly impressed and will definitely be sinking some more time into it very soon.\nYou may be imagining (as we were) that this title would be mostly about mashing your controller in a constant and concerted effort to retain the number one spot and hurtle your way through the stages of Le Tour, but this couldn’t be further form the game we’re presented with. Instead, fine strategy management is required for both your own stamina and your team’s efforts as well, to ensure a good finish for you at the end of each stage.\nIt’s a lot more in depth than we thought it would be, and for non-cycling enthusiasts, we’ve liked the detail and strategy which has been put into this, as well as the relaxing nature of the ride. While we’ve had an enjoyable (if sometimes a little baffling) experience, We imagine that this will be a hit for fans of the sport.\nSatisfaction: 7/10: It’s not a super high score but it’s definitely one we’ve enjoyed playing. While there’s nothing outstanding for us, we imagine that fans of Le tour or cycling in general may get a lot more out of the game though, and at £39.99, or 49.99 for the US and Europe, it’s not pricing itself out of the market.\nAs ever our Parent’s Guide above goes through all of the PEGI ratings and review elements, and don’t forget to Subscribe to keep up with all our News, Reviews, and Flashbacks.",

Rob took it to Tim Wilson and Mike Shannon at the Jackson factory in Ontario and had it completed into an assembled fully functional guitar.\nThis version of the prototype featured the revised RR V-shape like the previous black one but instead of being a string-thru-body hardtail, it was to be fitted with the Merlin 5-made brass tremolo that came on many of the strat-shaped Charvel's of that time. Grover at the time was becoming aquainted with a new trem designer named Gary Kahler about putting the Kahler tremolo on custom ordered Charvels. During this time, the tremolo was mentioned to Randy during the build stages of this guitar.\nRob told me Grover had it stored, wrapped up in the laundry room of his house in Mission Viejo (not far from where I now live).\nWe all know where the guitar is now via another thread in these message boards. Because Grover lives near me, I've had talks with Grover about it and he tells the story in a much broader light...it's always interesting to talk with Grover...lots of history in that dude!",

Curling up in the back seat with a pillow and blanket, falling asleep fifteen minutes into the movie. It was so much fun! And we all remember the drive-in movie scene in \"Grease\", a classic! My walk down memory lane started when I read an article in a newspaper from \"back home\" revealing that a drive-in theater in Lockport, New York is adding a fifth screen!\nSo I took to the Internet looking for drive-in theaters in Minnesota.

They take pride in being one of western Minnesota's premier movie destinations. Multiple screens showing all the latest movies and family classics. www.starlitemovies.com.\nVerne Drive In, Luverne.

This floral romper can certainly brighten up any rainy day and it's also a great investment piece that will effortlessly transition into summer.\nAlthough this romper is a little on the short side, layering a trench coat over it makes it a little bit more modest. It's still not meant for lunch with your grandma, but let's face it, sometimes you just need to live a little and wear something sassy! Come summer, you can rock this floral number by itself with that summer tan of yours, too (insert dancing girl emoji here)!\nI've talked about how to transition some of your winter favorites into spring, and this is yet another great example. These Steve Madden 'Gorgeous' over the knee boots are also on sale for $75 (#amazing)!

The ones I'm wearing in this post are fabulous for so many reasons! They are lightweight and don't weigh down your earlobe, you can get them personalized with two characters, AND you can get 10% off of these earrings or any other Taudrey goods with the code 'JONES10'!

    "text": "Dog rose is a host of a small gall wasp (Diplolepis rosae) which lives in a bright-red gall called a “robin’s pincushion”. It has nothing to do with robins, but is a maze of up to 60 chambers, each containing a larva. Plants make galls as a protection when attacked by insects, fungi, bacteria, mites and small worms.\nThe leaves are compound. They are alternate and each has 5-7 leaflets.\nThe leaves are usually hairless and dark green. The underside of the leaf is lighter.\nThere is great variety between different dog rose plants and many hybrids exist. This makes identification difficult as all forms are very similar.\nThe flowering period is usually in June and July. They have 5 petals and these can vary from white to a light pink. The flowers have a strong and pleasant smell.\nDog rose fruits are bright red, ripening in September and into October.\nThe fruits are eaten by birds and small mammals. They help to disperse the seeds. Another way that this plant reproduces is by sending out ‘suckers’ from its roots. These new plants are genetically identical to the parent.\nYou can make a jam from the fruits they are rich in vitamin C.\nThe rose doesn’t have thorns, but spines. A thorn is a modified branch or stem and is made from the same substance as the stem itself.\nA spine, on the other hand, is a modified leaf and is made from a different material than the stem. Spines and thorns serve a number of functions – mainly defence, an aid to climbing or ‘rambling’ through other plants and as a tool to reduce the evaporation of water – protecting the plant in drought conditions.\nDog rose grows, or ‘rambles’ up to 3m tall. It doesn’t often reach this height as the branches tend to arch over.\nThe most common place to find the dog rose is in hedges. It also grows on poor meadows, woods, scrubland and at the woodland edge.",

    "text": "es. Of course, the region is also home to a variety of unique activities, museums, restaurants and attractions that can be enjoyed during the colder season due to the climate. When planning your trip, consider these fun-filled vacation ideas.\nGet outdoors.Many parts of the country are too chilly to enjoy much time outdoors during the winter months, but heading south to an area like the Rio Grande Valley, home of the World Birding Center and National Butterfly Center, can provide the opportunity to find some time to appreciate nature. If you’re eager to see some wildlife, warmer climates can provide a true nature encounter, whether you visit a wildlife refuge or set out on a hike of your own. Plus, the moderate temperatures are appealing to many species.\nBring along your bucket list . Crossing items off your bucket list can be especially exciting when you’re on the road. If there’s an experience you’ve always wanted to create, there’s no place like vacation to make it happen. For example, if you’ve never touched a stingray, visit an aquarium with a hands-on display. Learn to surf or go parasailing.\nExperience local cuisine. One way to explore the true flavor of a new vacation destination is the culinary scene. Instead of dining at familiar chains and restaurants you can find nearly anywhere, plan your meals around unique, cultural fusion cuisine. On the Texas-Mexico border you can find hybrid cuisine featuring dishes like tacos, grilled steaks and cheesefilled tamales that serve as a nod to the unique crossover culture. If you’re in need of a recommendation, ask your hotel concierges where they like to go for a hearty breakfast or where you can find the best patio for lunch.\nSeek out unique attractions.The opportunity to see and experience things you can’t find anyplace else is one of the best advantages of exploring a new place. A unique destination in South Texas like Quinta Mazatlan is a luxurious historic mansion constructed in the 1930s that is thought to be the largest adobe structure in the state. Today, the home is open to the public as an urban sanctuary working to enrich people’s lives by sharing knowledge about birds, plants and environmental stewardship.",

I had studied the language for many years; it was the common language (along with English) of my European parents, and so I’d heard and spoken a lot of French before walking into the class (French 201? 203?) in East Pyne in the fall of 1980. Perhaps there were other, better courses I was missing?\nBut then I hadn’t known about Professor Maman. He had us all on that first morning — and I can almost remember all the others in the class, just from the memory of his deep voice bellowing “Monsieur Golfinos?” “Mademoiselle Beckett?” “Mademoiselle Lareuse?” “Monsieur Nagorski?” and so forth. Like the best of teachers, Maman was demanding and fun, in the right measures, and always engaging. He kept you on your toes, made you not only want to read Camus but come to class with something intelligent to say about it — in French, of course.\nMerci encore, Monsieur Maman!

    "text": "HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania is halting construction permits for natural gas pipelines operated by a company whose pipeline exploded last year, as the governor said Friday that Energy Transfer LP has failed to respect the state’s laws and communities.\nThe Department of Environmental Protection said Energy Transfer hasn’t stabilized the soil and erosion around its Revolution pipeline in western Pennsylvania, as it was ordered to do in October.\nAs a result, it is halting construction permits on the company’s pipelines in the state, it said.\n“This hold will continue until the operator corrects their violations to our satisfaction,” Environmental Protection Secretary Patrick McDonnell said in a statement.\nEnergy Transfer’s pipelines in Pennsylvania include the Mariner East 1, 2 and 2X natural gas liquids pipelines across southern Pennsylvania.\nThat has resulted in more than $13 million in fines and several temporary shutdown orders from state agencies, including one last month by the Public Utility Commission that has kept the Mariner East 1 pipeline shut down following a sinkhole that developed in suburban Philadelphia’s Chester County.\nNearby residents worried over sinkholes along the Mariner East pipelines sued Energy Transfer last summer in federal court. Chester County’s district attorney, Tom Hogan, is demanding documents from the company as part of a criminal investigation he opened.\nEnergy Transfer has said it is confident that it hasn’t violated criminal laws.",

    "text": "Africa has an acute shortage of world-class plant breeding specialists. At the moment, the continent has about 500 active breeders, which is about a tenth of the recommended number. Disproportionately, a majority of these specialists are men. This is despite the fact that women constitute the bulk of Africa’s agriculture labor force and the established wisdom of the higher returns on investing in women education and training.\nTo address this twin challenge, AGRA has invested over US$4m in the last 10 years to train plant breeders for the East and Southern Africa region through this programme implemented in partnership with the Africa Center for Crop Improvement (ACCI). This investment aims to tap the passion, will and commitment of students who believe that Africa’s weather, good soils, and human resource are sufficient to cater for the continent’s food needs.\nDr. Mamadou Mory Coulibaly works at the ‘Institut d’Economie Rurale’ (IER). Mory was funded by AGRA for his PhD at WACCI and is the first maize PhD trained breeder for Mali. He popularised a maize hybrid called Tieba which was entirely bred in Mali that is early maturing (100-105 days), high yielding (7-8 t/ha), drought tolerant and adapted to growing conditions in the country.\nDr. Aissata Mamadou Ibrahim, is the first female graduate of WACCI and the first female PhD plant breeder in her native country Niger. Aissata was funded by AGRA for her PhD from which she graduated in July 2012.",

    "text": "President Trump’s decision Monday to revive plans to freeze federal employee pay in 2020 and to institute a series of cuts to federal employee retirement programs was met with great consternation from stakeholder groups, although the ideas stand little chance of becoming law.\nIncreasing employee contributions toward federal defined benefit annuity programs by 1 percent per year until those payments reach 50 percent of the total cost.\nEliminating cost of living adjustments for FERS retirees, and reducing CSRS cost of living adjustments by 0.5 percent.\nEliminating the FERS supplement for employees forced to retire before Social Security kicks in at age 62.\nChanging annuity calculations for federal workers' retirement to be based on the average of their highest five years of salary, rather than the current highest three years.\nReducing the interest rate of the Thrift Savings Plan’s government securities (G) fund, basing it on the yield of either the three-month or four-week U.S. Treasury bill, rather than a weighted average of all Treasury investments.\nThe administration will not reveal the precise details of these proposals until next week. But each idea has been floated in some form in both 2017 and 2018, and Congress has not implemented any. The likelihood of any of these proposals being included in a final appropriations bill seems even slimmer now, with Democrats now in control of the House.\nManagement groups also criticized the White House’s approach to federal employee compensation. Although the Senior Executives Association was less overtly critical in its reaction, SEA President Bill Valdez said that the more positive elements of the fiscal roadmap would be undermined in practice by the decision to disinvest in the workforce.\n“Even as the budget proposal suggests that our national and homeland security requires additional staffing in the military and along our borders, the budget reiterates penny-wise and pound-foolish proposals to enact federal pay freezes and benefit and retirement cuts, thus implicitly assuring applicants interested in those posts that working for the federal government would mean enduring instability and ceaseless attacks surrounding even their most basic compensation,” Valdez said.",

Gathering data is one of many things you need in stock investment. Is that all enough? Not, you still need other things such as data analyzing and observing trend of investment based on specific news. Since there are a lot of things to do in your investment, you need to set enough time aside before you deal with it. Lucky for you, internet gives easy access of any data you need to make better investment, so you should benefit it.\nMaking investment on stock is about your ability of reading data on stock futures. In other words, you need to estimate some factors in order to be able to determine whether or not to invest your money at specific stocks. Some indicators on stock futures must be analyzed in details, so you can make a proper decision that lead to optimal profit. If you are a newbie in the stock investment, then consulting with an expert can be a choice and there will be many people who can give you a help in order that you can gain what it should in your investment.\nOne thing you need to bear in mind when it comes to investment is that risk goes in line with potential profit you can get, no matter what the financial instrument is. This rule applies to stock futures. Based on reliable data, investing money on stock is risky since it also offers high capital gain. This is the reason why paying attention to every single aspect of the investment is a must. Being an expert is a must if you want to invest your money on stock. Otherwise, you will get lost that will make you feel depressed.",

The report added that the company is negotiating with its banks to increase its borrowings before quarterly rent payment date of March 25 and a CVA would let the company renegotiate its rent with landlords and expedite its store closures.\nAs a part of its restructuring plan, the company has already made a number of decisions, such as tightening the leadership team and stopping some non-core activities to concentrate on managing the core business. Last week, Debenhams said that it is entering into consultation with colleagues in both the London and Taunton Support Centres and expect the current proposals would result in around 60 colleagues leaving the business.\nDuring the 6 weeks to January 5, 2019, the company’s group gross transaction value declined 3.8 percent, with group like-for-like sales down 3.4 percent.

MY beautiful daughter was outgoing, she played in the band at school and eventually became the drum major. She also possessed an awesome alto voice.\nSo it did not surprise me at all when she graduated with a full scholarship to attend college. She began dating a young man, unknown to me, that was hooked on prescription medications. At age 19, she married him and they had a child.\nIt wasn’t long before she too had the habit. Her father and I did everything we knew to do to get her off the drugs and alcohol. Six years later she got into heroin and morphine and divorced and took up with another young man who had the same habits. They also had a child.\nI received a call on Halloween of 2009 from DHR to come get the children. When I got there, it was apparent that they were under the influence. It has all escalated from there. She does not have the children, we do.\nShe finally got arrested in the fall of 2010 and was forced to get off the drugs and go to rehab. At that time, I saw a small bit of my daughter returning. But it was not to be. She went back to the same habits, now she is running from doctor to doctor getting prescription medicines and overtaking them.\nI am afraid for her to be around the kids and I try to monitor that situation, the courts say I have to let her see them. She stays with my parents, has never had a job, has nothing but her car. She has become a hoarder and has other mental issues.\nI have been to mental authority – they will not take her because she is on the medicines that now she has prescriptions for. She overtakes them, such a sad situation. Does anyone have an answer? She refuses to believe she has a problem at all and will try to have you arrested if you try to help.\nDangerous Bedtime Habits that you should always Avoid!!",

Siemens reported sales of 83.04 billion Euro (US$93.73 billion) for the fiscal year ending September of 2018. This represents a decrease of 0.0% versus 2017, when the company's sales were 83.05 billion Euro. The sales level in 2018 was fairly close to the level five years ago: in 2013, Siemens had sales of 75.88 billion Euro. Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 19.7% decline in Power and Gas, from 15.41 billion Euro to 12.38 billion Euro. There were also decreases in sales in Healthineers (down 3.1% to 13.32 billion Euro) and Reconciliation (down 14.1% to 1.09 billion Euro) . However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of Digital Factory (up 14.8% to 12.23 billion Euro) and Energy Management (up 0.4% to 11.68 billion Euro) and Wind Power and Renewables (up 15.2% to 9.12 billion Euro) and Mobility (up 7.9% to 8.72 billion Euro) and Process Industries and Drives (up 0.3% to 7.22 billion Euro) and Building Technologies (up 1.9% to 6.48 billion Euro) and Financial Services (Sfs) (up 4.9% to 812.00 million Euro) .",

On Day 1, the workshop was in a ‘taught format’, and covered topics from identifying the adequate funding programmes, content development & grant writing to budget planning. Day 2 offered a proposal simulation game to allow for a hands-on preparation of a typical proposal outline, including a guided group work, evaluation/discussion, and feedback from the speakers. This model of specialized training workshops have proven successful in the German research landscape and the idea was to hold similar events in India, with focus on proposal writing and project management skill development that would enable young scientists in India, particularly those from partner institutions of the applying organizations to successfully apply for existing Indo-German joint programs and other international research funding opportunities. The workshop aimed to help sharpen the skills of the participants to apply for individual and collaborative third party funding programs.\nPhD students, Post Docs, Young Faculty from the Life Sciences.\nGroup work: how would you assess your present career situation and perspective?\nThe DWIH workshop was organised by the Max Planck Society (MPG) and Freie Universität Berlin India offices, in partnership with IndiaBioscience .",

So it seems only right that one of our rare gigs (Julie Kay and Myself, of course) is at this very place. And yes , on this very day.\nAnd we’re bringing something special tonight. A taste of a harvest meal upcoming.\nSince The Grimm Generation went on super secret hiatus, I started crafting songs about loss. Conceptual. Very real. And a record was born. Still cooking with our top scientists working on it (Hi Adam!). So what we have here is a preview of whats to come. Played live in one set. Acoustic voice and stompy foot. Cello sensuality in pluck and box. Lyric driven, image laden. We’re coming from and for the heart.\nSo as a delectable aperitif, the set, as it will be played tonight at 7:00 PM at Klekolo World Coffee, Court St in the grand old dame of Middletown.\nPlease join us for a live viewing of the upcoming album ‘The Zen Of Losing’ as performed by Jason P. Krug (vocals, guitar) and Julie Kay (cello) at Klekolo World Coffee, Court St in Middletown, 7:00 pm sharp.",

For that reason, it is imperative that you both work together to ensure your child makes the most out of their academic life. To learn what you should discuss next time you meet with the teacher, read the post below.\nIs your child being bullied? Is your child a bully? Are they a loner? Are they loud? Children can act very differently at school and at home. Learning about your child's social status will give you a better idea of who they are and how healthy their relationships are.\nSome people learn better with visual cues. Others, with auditory stimuli. While others require movement and touch. Ask the teacher about your child's learning style so you can both adapt to it and provide a more effective learning experience for your child.\nJust as the information the teacher gives you about your child can be very useful to you, so is the one you can provide to them. Ask them if there's anything they wish to know regarding your child, so the teacher can be properly informed and act accordingly.\nThese four little words can be music to a teacher's ears. This is because they let them know that you are a parent who is willing to work with them. Moreover, this opens up the dialogue between the two of you, which can benefit your child immensely.\nCall The Tutoring Center, League City TX at (281) 337-2800 if your child requires academic assistance (such as one-to-one tutoring in League City TX) to become a better student.",

The former Arkansas quarterback’s absence at Thursday’s practice came just a few days after the organization named Brian Hoyer the team’s starting quarterback.\nReports surfaced later in the day that Mallett had slept through the Thursday practice.\nMallett’s decline this pre-season is a surprise to many experts around the league who believed that the young QB was in contention for the starting spot after her performed relatively well as the team’s starting quarterback for the final two games of the 2014 season.\nAdding to the quarterback’s woes is the fact that HBO is currently filming the Texans’ preseason for the popularity football-based reality TV show Hard Knocks.\nCameras were rolling when O’Brien told Mallett that Hoyer was chosen to be the team’s starting quarterback.\nThe day after O’Brien broke the news, Mallett told reporters that he was “a little bit angry” with the decision.\nMallett said Tuesday he was disappointed and a little bit angry after losing the competition.\nPro Football Talk noted that the quarterback’s chances of taking the top spot from Hoyer are based solely on his performance.\nIn response to the report, commenters shared their opinions about the fifth-year gunslinger.",

IAVA, the nation’s leading voice of the Post-9/11 Generation of Veterans, is calling on NBC moderator Lester Holt to press the candidates to outline specific policies that address the issues facing our nation’s veterans and their families as a part of tonight’s conversation billed as “Securing America”, which is expected to focus on national security.\nHow would you stop the outrageous rate of veteran suicide in America taking 20 lives every day?\nWould you privatize the VA or not?\nDo you support the pending Senate plan to cut the New GI Bill by approximately $3B included in the “Veterans First” act? Will you stand with veterans and oppose all cuts to the New GI Bill?\nWhy did you choose to not serve in the military? There are over 22 million veterans in America and over 93% of IAVA members intend to vote this November. A recent Military Times poll has Trump currently leading in the military with almost 37.6%. Gary Johnson was at 36.5%, Clinton at 16.3% and Stein at 1.2%.\nThe first presidential debate will take place at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY at 9 p.m.\nIAVA Founder and CEO, Paul Rieckhoff is available for media.

Student, Firoz never wanted her sister to stop her studies, so she sacrificed her education due to financial problems. She participated in the game show to win a certain amount to pay off her deceased father’s loan. On the second last day of the game, Firoz had lost all her hopes to make it to the hot seat. But her knowledge which she gathered only by reading newspapers and watching news channels helped her reach the most celebrated hot seat.\nAfter winning a crore an excited Firoz said, “I was very nervous when I wasn’t able to make it to the hot seat in the second last episode and felt I have to go home empty handed. But then I aced the fastest finger first round and made my way to the hot seat. Also, I didn’t feel as the 1 Crore winner until the audience clapped and Bachchanji hugged me. It is a great feeling”.\nWith the winning amount, Firoz wants to help her family get rid of the loan and study further. She also wants her mother to live a tension free life.",

It is also the first time that such a far-reaching legislative revolution has taken place thanks to a decision made by the producers themselves, in this case the 600 or so members of the Consortium. Chianti Classico is the first Italian designation to aim higher, and decide to promote everything, starting with its excellent quality products. This decision bucks the current global trend, with the goal of offering a higher standard of quality in the local winemaking sector.\nGran Selezione is produced from exclusively estate-grown grapes in the best-suited vineyards, applying strict regulations, which make it a highly prestigious wine and a new benchmark for the international winemaking scene.\nAs well as possessing the necessary chemical and sensory features for a high quality wine, before release Gran Selezione must be aged for at least 30 months in including three months of bottle ageing, with a subsequent required period of bottle maturation.\nGran Selezione is also credited with enhancing the various characteristic aspects of a vast and varied territory divided into nine municipalities, which differ greatly in climatic and pedological features, but are united by the unmistakeable “signature” of Sangiovese grapes. In sensory terms, Gran Selezione is a well-structured wine showing excellent balance and harmony thanks to grape selection and lengthy ageing, as well as deep, complex flavours and aromas. The palate displays approachable fruity sensations alongside the captivating hints typical of ageworthy wines.",

While empathy and encouragement are highly recommended, there are times when reassurance may do the opposite of what we intend. For some people, reassurance becomes a crutch. People feel like they need someone to tell them everything is going to be okay in order to complete a task or face a difficult situation. A little reassurance here and there is harmless, but when it is absolutely necessary for someone to be able to function this is a red flag.\nFor example, if a family member is not willing to go to a party unless you go with them or remind them everything is going to be okay the whole time you are there, they are likely over-reliant on you as a safety person. Reassurance may get them through the moment, but it ends up maintaining their anxiety in the long run. It becomes difficult for the person to rely on themselves and function on their own. And children especially need to learn to cope on their own because we cannot always be there.\nBasically, we do not want to make promises we can’t keep or pretend that we can control situations that we cannot. I can never make the promise that nothing bad is going to happen or that everything is going to be okay. Although this might be the highly probable in the situation, I cannot guarantee it. There is a chance that something could go wrong. A really hard concept for many people to grasp is that life does not have guarantees, but we do things and take appropriate risks anyway. And we live with ambiguity and uncertainty all the time. Additionally, we do not want to indicate that there is something wrong with feeling scared and that this feeling means we have to be rescued or retreat.\nSo how can we be supportive without providing reassurance?\n1. Validate Feelings: It is important not to sugar coat situations. The best thing we can do is recognize and validate what is going on in the present moment. This is especially important when we are facing uncomfortable or scary situations. For example, recognizing that the situation is scary, that it might hurt, or that we might feel like we want to flee are all important feelings to express and validate.",

    "text": "In a provocative study, Paul Sonnino examines the diplomatic negotiations that took place in Westphalia from 1643 to 1648, which brought an end to the agonizing civil and religious conflict of the Thirty Years’ War.\nSonnino steps back from myriad historical readings of Westphalia to take the diplomats’ intentions and interactions strictly on their own terms. He places the reader alongside the pivotal figure of French minister Jules Cardinal Mazarin as he maneuvers for gain. The narrative thus offers a firsthand experience of the negotiations as they played out, as well as a penetrating look into the character, personality, and ideas of the crafty cardinal. Although Mazarin acquired the province of Alsace—making him a hero to French nationalists—he had a much more successful peace within his grasp, but lost it when he insisted on annexing the Spanish Low Countries. Sonnino also offers a new interpretation of the origins of the Fronde, linking the French domestic revolt to foreign policy, in Mazarin’s failure to secure peace with Spain.\nBased on unprecedented archival documentation, Mazarin’s Quest provides an original and illuminating look at one of the most complicated diplomatic gatherings of all time.",

Teaching art is a passion of mine. I love to see the \"lights come on\", when a student suddenly understands a new art concept or technique. This often begins the process of a new way to look at and approach endeavors of creativity.\n1) Refresh his/her memory about what has been discussed and what is expected.\nwill be additional materials often that need to be opened and/or printed off that were originally handed out in class.\n3) Accessing information on line cuts down the unnecessary use of paper which is good for the environment.\n4) Due dates are posted on this site and are easy to access.\n5) Students can share with their families what is happening in class by using this website.\nDraw/Paint One is a class geared towards beginners but also provides guidance and assignments that easily allow for more advanced students to be challenged and create amazing pieces of art work. We begin by learning the basics of drawing through the exploration of the Elements of Art. This class is similar to any other At East in that each project or lesson prepares the student for what is to come.\nCeramics One is a class for beginners. We begin with handbuilding and gradually work towards throwing on the wheel. Proper technique and finish work is emphasized as well as care of the studio and tools.\nWe create functional and non functional ceramic pieces. Students will also learn how to sculpt using clay.\nPinch pot building, slab construction and coil construction are all part of this class. We also create pieces using combined techniques.",

Sadly for the New Zealander his over zealousness led to him taking an uncomfortable fall on the final turn.\nBut, most unexpectedly, the new track record at the East of England Arena, Brady Kurtz ran a last place in heat 13 and with Rohan Tungate making a superlative pass on Jack Holder the home side were able to level the meeting once again.\nThat track record by Kurtz was accomplished in heat 6 when he breezed round the circuit in a four lap time of 57.8 seconds, shaving one-tenth of the time set by Max Fricke on April 1st this year who had lowered the previous fastest of 58.4 that had stood for nine years.\nPeterborough weighed in with a valuable 5-1 when eve of season signing Aaron Summers was well backed up by Charles Wright, the pair refusing to give Richie Worrall or Busk Jakobsen a look in. That left the Pirates needing to respond with a 5-1 of their own to eek out the draw on the night and whilst both Holder and Klindt made a great effort with solid starts, former Pirate Hans Andersen ensured the home win for the Panthers by getting in between them.",

    "text": "Silver Tree has attractive grayish green-variegated silver foliage. The fuzzy oval leaves are highly ornamental and remain silver throughout the winter. Neither the flowers nor the fruit are ornamentally significant.\nSilver Tree is a multi-stemmed evergreen tree with a shapely oval form. Its relatively fine texture sets it apart from other landscape plants with less refined foliage.\nSilver Tree will grow to be about 40 feet tall at maturity, with a spread of 20 feet. It has a low canopy with a typical clearance of 1 foot from the ground, and should not be planted underneath power lines. It grows at a medium rate, and under ideal conditions can be expected to live for approximately 30 years.\nThis tree should only be grown in full sunlight. It does best in average to evenly moist conditions, but will not tolerate standing water. It is particular about its soil conditions, with a strong preference for poor, alkaline soils, and is able to handle environmental salt. It is somewhat tolerant of urban pollution, and will benefit from being planted in a relatively sheltered location. This species is not originally from North America.\nSilver Tree is a fine choice for the yard, but it is also a good selection for planting in outdoor pots and containers. Because of its height, it is often used as a 'thriller' in the 'spiller-thriller-filler' container combination; plant it near the center of the pot, surrounded by smaller plants and those that spill over the edges. Note that when grown in a container, it may not perform exactly as indicated on the tag - this is to be expected. Also note that when growing plants in outdoor containers and baskets, they may require more frequent waterings than they would in the yard or garden. Be aware that in our climate, this plant may be too tender to survive the winter if left outdoors in a container. Contact our store for more information on how to protect it over the winter months.",

    "text": "When you’re on the road, you often want to pull off for a cup of coffee or a bite to eat. Once you do, the road starts to beckon again almost immediately.\nLeesville, New York, was one of the most western posts on the First Great Western Turnpike, built as a toll road from Albany, the state capital, to the frontier town of Cherry Valley in the late 18th century. Commerce didn’t come cheap – drivers (of a different sort) paid 3 cents per dozen to move their sheep and swine along the road. No tolls were collected from people going to or returning from church or the grist mill, or from those who were on military duty or on journeys within the town where the tollgate was located.\nThis is as urban as it gets along Route 20 in New York, as it passes through the state capital of Albany. Here it runs along the Empire State Plaza, home to the offices of state legislators and executive branch agencies. More compelling, perhaps, is the egg-shaped structure called, appropriately enough, The Egg, a performing arts center that descends six stories below ground level.\nModern-day Albany is a far cry from its early days. It was first settled as the Dutch trading posts of Fort Nassau (1614) and lays claim to being the longest continually chartered city in the United States (chartered in 1686).",

The hotel is contemporary in decor with Asian accents but not overpowering. Many celebrities have stayed at this hotel near downtown Miami with 180 degree view of the water. All restaurants, the pool, lounge bar, gym, and massage suites face the glittering water.\nThe Mandarin houses two restaurants--Azul and Cafe Sambal.\nCafe Sambal is the more casual of the two but with upscale standards and resides on the lower level. Embroidered by an inner band of rich, fuschia-colored bougainvillea and surrounded by glistening green-blue water, the alfresco dining section is like a brilliant ruby and emerald gem ring setting. The Miami Skyline in the backdrop was surreal. Not many restaurants can boast both water and skyline view.\nFor an appetizer, the soy beans \"Steamed Edamame with Hawaiian Seasalt\" was highly recommended by Kristin, the Sales Manager. Placing the string of beans in between my teeth to remove the encapsulated bean (similar to cracking sunflower seeds and separating the seed from the shell), I pulled the other end of the bean for a clean sweep. The glittering bronze sea salt was the singular flavor. The Edamame is eaten for the experience and the health factor. At $8.00 for a deep dish bowl, the edamame is a pure protein snack. Once you have one, you can't stop until the bowl is empty.\nOverall, this restaurant deserves high marks for food, flavor and ambience. Prices are on the high end which is to be expected for an upscale hotel for the rich and famous.\nIf you visit Cafe Sambal, please return to this posting and share your experience by clicking on \"Comments\" just below this article.",

Maria Cantwell of Washington state on Tuesday.\nCantwell’s committee has direct oversight over the Interior Department. There is some suspicion that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke may have had a hand in the company winning the contract because it is based in his hometown.\nZinke said he had nothing to do with the contract being awarded by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.\nThe GAO is a federal watchdog agency that looks into concerns when requested to do so by members of Congress. Cantwell’s request is the first concrete step that lawmakers have said they would take to investigate the contract award after it was reported late Monday.\nSenior members from both parties on the House Natural Resources Committee said Tuesday that they are looking into the matter, as well.\nNatural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop, R-Utah, also will be looking into the contract, his office said.",

After a long day at work, what woman wouldn’t want to sit back with a bowl full of snacks and escape into a fantasy land inhabited by their favorite characters? Movies and television bring to life our favorite characters and keep our emotions swinging whether we are perched on the edge of our seats in anticipation, wiping away a tear, or laughing so hard we’ve fallen out of the chair. With a wide variety of genres including comedy, drama, action, science fiction, variety shows, reality shows and more, there is sure to be a TV or movie costume for women that will be a “must-see” and “must-wear” on your lineup.\nRetro TV has inspired many womens costumes based on the campy, kitschy and crazy characters such as the well-meaning but pesky Jeannie from “I Dream of Jeannie” and the dark yet delightful Morticia from “The Addams” family. Cartoon and superhero characters that will make you feel nostalgic are Jane and Judy Jetson, Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble, and Batgirl, Supergirl and the iconic Wonder Woman. The long-running comedy show, Saturday Night Live, has plenty of humorous characters for women to parody including a Spartan cheerleader, Mary Katherine Gallagher, a conehead, Rosanna Danna and more. If you’re a movie buff, then you’ll give an award-winning performance as Princess Leia from “Star Wars”, the bride from “Kill Bill” or a character from the “Rocky Horror Picture Show”.",

The record came from New York Times and stated that Facebook has been sharing data like usernames, contact details, usernames of good friends, likes, etc. without the approval of the customer.\nVisitors may be asking yourself why Facebook would do this without any advantage. However the fact is that Facebook is profiting mostly from it. They would have a lot more website traffic on their site, their customer base would raise and also the advertisements they get from their marketers would also expand in number. All this suggests an increase in revenue for Facebook. They might even market the information for financial returns from 3rd parties.\nThis is not the first time Facebook has actually been accused of selling its users’ data to 3rd parties. In April, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg needed to encounter the Congressional hearing relating to numerous claims made by studies as well as studies on Facebook. Nonetheless, Mark rejected the claims entirely, saying “We do not market information to any individual”. Whether that holds true, users, regulators, as well as media have actually taken it out on Facebook concerning privacy violations.\nAltogether, Facebook has actually turned into one of the biggest marketplaces for data on the web and the users do not also find out about it. Breaking out social media accounts, online search engine and also applications are simply ‘information losses in disguise’. All of the data that these web sites, applications, and systems accumulate are being utilized to set a target audience and also obtain advertisements.\nIn April, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg had to face the Legislative hearing concerning several claims made by researches and surveys on Facebook.

Even if security services managed to protect symbolic sites and the most popular areas around cities, nearby streets or neighbourhoods would still be vulnerable, he says.\nBoth IS and Al-Qaeda have urged their followers to use whatever means at their disposal, including vehicles, as part of a strategy of 'death by a thousand cuts' aimed at destroying the west.\nThe Radicalization Awareness Network, an EU research body, warned last month that 1,200-3,000 jihadists risked returning to Europe after fighting in Iraq and Syria - out of an estimated 5,000 who joined the terror groups there.",

    "text": "Director Patty Jenkins has revealed details about the upcoming sequel.\nIf we've learned anything from our era of superhero movies, it's that no one is actually really dead. At the end of Wonder Woman, Chris Pine's Steve Trevor heroically sacrifices himself to save everyone else. It marked the death of some great on-screen chemistry between Pine and Gal Gadot.\nBut today, director Patty Jenkins has revealed the first details about the upcoming sequel, Wonder Woman 1984. It takes place in, well, 1984, and somehow marks the return of Pine's Steve Trevor. Jenkins tweeted a photo of Pine on set for the film, and he's got a great fit with a Member's Only jacket and a vintage Casio watch. He also looks pretty damn good for being either dead or at least 90 years old. Considering this is a superhero movie there are any number of reasons why Trevor would still be alive.\nThis sequel has Wonder Woman squaring off against The Cheetah, played by Kristin Wiig. While there have been a few versions of The Cheetah, all the characters have roughly the same powers, which \"consists of enhanced strength and speed well beyond that of the most powerful felines, as well as heightened senses of smell and hearing for hunts and night-vision for stealth. Their reflexes and agility are similarly augmented, allowing them superior gymnastic and parkour feats for inhuman mobility. These superhuman traits allow them to challenge Wonder Woman in physical battles. Additionally, their fangs and claws are preternaturally sharp and strong.\"\nAnyway, we'll know for sure when the movie is out on November 1, 2019.",

I was struggling at one point and gave myself a break by walking between a lamppost then carried on. It wasn't long after that Alan & Richard caught up with me. Alan passed by and Richard and I completed the last few kilometres together. Chatting helped to distract from the legs telling me they wanted to stop and have a brew! So thanks to Richard for helping me finish the route.\nIn terms of the new running light, it was great.

    "text": "Protecting your mortgage might be the last thing you think about when faced with an onslaught of wildfires, like the ones threatening thousands of properties in Southern California.\nThis year has been the costliest year in recorded history from wildfires nationwide, according to the Department of Agriculture. And that does not include the recent wildfires in California, which have threatened nearly 25,000 homes and destroyed more than 1,000 structures, according to reports.\nWhen faced with a disaster like a wildfire, you may be eligible to get relief from your mortgage payments. Call your lender as soon as possible to ask if it’s offering financial relief.\nEach bank or mortgage lender will offer different types of financial relief depending on your situation, but you won’t know until you call.\nMany lenders are not requiring documentation, like a mortgage statement, since often times people have evacuated their homes where their paperwork is stored. In some cases, the home does not have to be damaged to get financial relief. You may be eligible for financial help because you can’t get back to work due to an evacuation, or because you need time to get connected with an insurance company, says Tom Kelly, spokesman at JPMorgan Chase.\nMajor lenders including Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo confirmed they are offering some form of financial relief for people impacted by the wildfires depending on each person’s situation.\nThe type of financial assistance will vary with each lender. But during past wildfires this year, some California banks waived late payment fees, deferred payments for up to 90 days, or delayed reporting a credit issue to the bureaus, says Beth Mills, a spokeswoman for the California Bankers Association.\nWells Fargo, for example, is offering to halt any late fees, collection calls or negative reporting to the credit bureaus for customers impacted by the wildfires, says Tom Goyda, a spokesman at Wells Fargo. The bank is also offering certain foreclosure protections.\n“We are offering disaster assistance to customers impacted by the wildfires when they contact us,” he says.",

He sailed around Cape Horn ten times before settling on a career with the ferries operating to Ireland out of Holyhead. He saw active service in the First World War, came under fire during the Irish Troubles in the 1920s, and led a party of sailors who successfully prevented the Irish Light Ship Alexandria being scuttled. He received two Royal Humane Society Certificates on Vellum for bravery, rescuing people from the Irish Sea.\nIn 1940, a captain of the requisitioned ferry HMT Scotia, he was awarded the DSC for his gallantry during the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk.\nDewi B. Francis was born in Nantlle, Caernarfonshire, the son of one of the renowned Brodyr Francis singing duo. Educated at Pen-y-groes County School and, after wartime service in the RAF, the Normal College, Bangor, he taught in Anglesey throughout his career, becoming the headmaster of Kingland and Llanfawr Schools in Holyhead. He is the son-in-law of Captain William Henry Hughes, the subject of this biography. In 1986 he was created an MBE for his services to education and the community.",

    "text": "On the 5th of December, year 10 went on a trip to the Warwick Arts Centre in Coventry to watch a series of science lectures, ranging from Saturn and its rings to the earliest stages of life. Our day started with a talk from Helen Pilcher who told us about de-extinction, a science that looks at the possibility of extinct species becoming alive once again. We learnt about scientists who are using DNA and stem cells as well as a gene editing tool called the Crispr and how long DNA can potentially survive. This followed with a talk from Professor Robert Winston who spoke to us about the early stages of life and the breakthroughs in stem cell research and use. We heard about scientists who have found ways to separate cells in a embryo without damaging the structure.\nAfter a break, we heard from Sheila Kanani from the Royal Astronomical Society who spoke to us about the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft. She told us about the discoveries scientists were able to make about Saturn because of this spacecraft, including the discovery that there are over 60 moons of Saturn and how each of them are completely different. We learnt that before the end of the mission in September 2017, the equipment had been in space for almost twenty years! She showed us some amazing photos that the spacecraft had taken of Saturn, its moons and a picture of our moon from Saturn. After this, we watched a presentation on how to make revision more successful using different techniques.\nWe then had a lunch break, and after this break we had a series of demonstrations from Stephen Ashworth, entitled ‘kitchen chemistry.’ He showed us how different chemicals that most people have in their homes can be used in different ways. Finally, Marty Jopson spoke to us about how mathematical equations can apply to real life situations. We learnt that the crack of a whip is faster than the speed of sound because of a huge build up of energy. We saw some amazing demonstrations throughout this presentation including the burning of hydrogen and Marty burning some cellulose on his hand.\nThe day as a whole was really interesting and it was amazing to see how science can be used in such a variety of ways.",

    "text": "WELCOME to the Home Page of Prestbury Local History Society, Gloucestershire.\nThere has been a village in Prestbury since before the Norman Conquest; the Domesday survey records a settlement of about 25 families and a priest. The Parish boundaries established in Anglo-Saxon times remain almost unchanged to our own day. They define a long thin area stretching from the hill top East of the village almost to the main line railway in the West.\nThe presence of Cheltenham, no more than one and a half miles southwest, has had considerable influence on Prestbury for both good and ill. Competition from the bigger town must have been partly responsible for the decline of Prestbury’s medieval market, established in 1249. By the 15th century it was in serious decline and a subsequent attempt to revive it fared no better. On the other hand, the growing prosperity of Cheltenham offered increasing opportunities for employment and trade for villagers. In the 19th century Prestbury growers and farmers helped to supply the tables of Cheltenham, and Prestbury housed many of the building workers for the expanding spa town.\nPrestbury cannot claim a starring role in national events, but it was touched and changed by all the great movements of English history. The way they played out on the small stage of a village makes their human impact very real. The decline of feudalism and the rise of a middle class, the Reformation, the Civil War, increasing professionalism in agriculture, all have their reflection in the story of Prestbury. Today, the built-up area of Cheltenham extends to and includes Prestbury, but a strong village identity persists. There are flourishing schools, 2 churches, shops, 4 pubs, a hall and a library. Many residents have deep family roots here, and one of the aims of Prestbury Local History Society is the collection and preservation of their memories. History continues to the present.",

    "text": "Games Workshop, after so many years of ignoring the fans, has finally started listening and is churning out boardgames at a great rate. Some are better than others, and all are horrendously overpriced by any normal standards, but there are some gems, and this one seems to be in that special category.\nOf course it’s not at all related to the old Warhammer Quest really – it’s all about the IP these days isn’t it? – but that’s a good thing, as the game here is more fun and interesting than that venerable but creaky dungeoncrawler. With bits of dice allocation (a la Claustrophobia) and paragraph reading (Tales of the Arabian Nights) in the mix and some decent variety in the scenarios, there’s something to please everyone.\nDespite the premium cost, corners are still visibly being cut, which is a shame. The creatures could have had their own reference cards, for example. As usual, those not interested in assembling and painting miniatures certainly have their work cut out for them before they start playing. And I do think there could have been less small minis to fill out the miniature count.\nBut the minis you do get are incredibly detailed and high quality, and it’s good to see a bit of experimentation with the dungeoncrawler form. Though why are so many GW characters leaping into the air these days?",

After a several year hiatus Harry has brought back Ray Lilly, and all the magic in The Twisted Path.\nThe Twenty Palaces series tells the tale of Ray Lilly, a former convict turned into a magician's decoy, or Wooden Man. It is Lilly's job to distract evil creatures from the deep and dark, while his master Annalise burns them with primal green fire. They keep on saving the world from some pretty nasty demons that have crossed over.\nWooden Men aren't supposed to last more than one mission, but somehow Ray keeps on surviving. The Twenty Palaces Society has taken notice and calls Ray and Annalise to Europe, this does not bode well.\nConnolly's Lovecraft-ian/Geiger-style lore and world building is amazing. I have enjoyed all of his novels and novellas, but none have been as anticipated as The Twisted Path. If you are new to this series, I highly recommend starting with Child of Fire, the which was also Harry's debut novel.\nRay and Annalise' return is every bit as exciting as I'd hoped.",

My Grandma came with us as we went to the Greengrocers on the way to get their shopping. It was very funny because Grandma kept telling Grandad off but he’d just take the mickey out of her back. Me and Chris really struggle with that because sometimes Chris can actually be really person and really hurt my feelings.\nAnyway we were in the car on the way back and it got even more sillier!!! Thats for sure! They chatted about where my Grandad used to live (the garage is about 3 minutes down the road from where my Great-Grandma and Great-Grandad used to live. Great-Grandma died when I was in Year 10 – I would have be about 14 and Great-Grandad now lives in a Old Folkies Home) and then my Grandma was going to show me where she used to live and then she completely missed it – she was too busy talking about how Grandad used to cycle through the village to her house to pick her up to go “courting”. It was very very very sweet.\njust thought I’d pop by and say thanks. I did try to look for an email address for you but couldn’t find one.",

Click Download or Read Online button to ANOINTED BY THE SPIRIT A STUDY OF JESUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS book pdf for free now.\nWe are to proclaim the gospel, make disciples, baptize them, and teach them to obey everything Jesus taught his first followers. That surely includes ministry in the power of the Spirit.\nFor centuries Christians have had the concept of the priesthood of all believers firmly engrained in their minds. The prophethood of all believers, on the other hand, is, so Stronstad believes, the main focus of Spirit-baptism in Luke-Acts. A landmark study in Lukan pneumatology, this book is aimed at a mixed readership ranging from the scholar to the informed layperson. The role of the Spirit in Luke is clearly portrayed in terms of vocational empowerment. Traditionally, Lukan pneumatology has been viewed through Pauline or Johannine spectacles, but by interpreting Luke independently of the other Gospels and the epistles, Stronstad has cogently argued for the historical and contemporary relevance of Spirit-baptism. He challenges the reader to develop a new appreciation of Luke's theology of the Holy Spirit, and, in fact, to consider the role of the prophethood of all believers for today's world.\nRecent research on the Johannine literature has concluded that behind these writings stands a flourishing community of Christians who lived under the tutelage of the Beloved Disciple, preserved his writings, and venerated his memory. In this book, Gary M. Burge examines one feature of this community's belief and experience: the role of the Spirit in its view both of Christ and of the Christian experience.",

    "text": "The Airline Vikings were playing for the state football championship in 1972 against Neville on a bad night for football in Monroe.\nBut after the team had gathered itself, head coach Jack Gray called his seniors together.\nGray, who coached the 1967 Airline team to the state title, passed away Thursday and services are set for Saturday at 3 p.m. in Marshall, Texas, where he lived. Visitation is Friday from 5 to 7 p.m.\nGray’s niece, Becky Gray, is the assistant principal at Parkway and his brother lives in Bossier City. He is survived by his wife, Mimi, and a son, Gary who lives in Farmerville.\nSlack said Gray was the kind of coach any teenager would love to have.\n“He was caring, loving and gentle, but he always expected the best out of you,” Slack said.\nIn 1971, Slack said it was well known that Gray, a native of Shelbyville, Texas, went to Marshall to interview for the head coaching job there.\nWhen the Vikings played at Texarkana, Arkansas, as juniors, the team had a huge defensive end named Ronald Johnson, the brother of NFL All-Pro Gary “Big Hands” Johnson.\n“Ronald had a forearm that would knock you out and he injured a couple of the Texarkana players. They were the top team in Arkansas and we beat them,” Slack said. “The next year when we play them, they’re out to get Ronald and it started a huge fight at the end of the game, which was never finished. They were chasing Ronald all over the field, so he finally ran to our sideline and picked up one of the downs markers and started swinging it at them.\nGray was originally hired at Airline by John Ropp not long after Airline opened in 1964. He also coached at Ruston High and then later at Marshall, where he was also athletic director and an administrator.\nAfter retirement, Gray and his wife were active in delivering “Meals on Wheels” and working with the Humane Society. He was a member of the Trinity Episcopal Church in Marshall, where his service will be held.",

Today, The Tennis Recruiting Network and CrampsAWAY kick off our coverage of Signing Week 2018, and our slate of articles is ready to go.\nThis Wednesday, November 14th, is Signing Day - the first day that high school seniors can formally commit to Division I or II tennis programs. We have been counting down the days for the past month, but today we switch to our Signing Week coverage.\nFirst thing’s first. Let’s check in on the blue chip seniors.\nThe tables below show the blue chip athletes and their latest recruiting statuses. The Commitment column shows whether the recruit has made a verbal commitment or is undecided, while the Interests column indicates schools of interest for uncommitted players.\nAs was the case back in October, there are only a few blue chip boys remaining on the table - and there has been no real movement with the four remaining uncommitted boys. All of these players are keeping their candidate schools private.\nWe will continue to reach out to these boys over the coming weeks - and keep you up to date on their progress.\nThere has been some excitement on the girls side with two blue chip girls announcing their commitments over the past week. Angelica Blake of Boca Raton, Florida, got things started by announcing her commitment to Stanford, which TRN carried in this article.\nLater in the week, Gia Cohen, who has been focusing on ITF junior and professional events kept things moving when she announced her commitment to Georgia Tech. Cohen has gone 11-4 in ITF junior tournaments over the past year - including an appearance in the singles semifinal at the Eddie Herr International last November.\nAll in all, 16 of the 26 blue chip girls have now announced their commitments, and that number will go up by at least one on Signing Day. This Wednesday, three-time state champion Alana Wolfberg plans to announce her commitment. We will have coverage of that announcement right here at TRN.\nWe will keep an eye on all of these players as their stories continue to develop … but we already have a lot of content on the schedule.

Sheriff’s officials also did not identify him.\nThe three shooting victims had been riding in a minivan. They flagged down an ambulance crew just after 9:40 p.m. at Rosecrans Boulevard and Marquardt Avenue, Lt. Dave Dolson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau said.\n“The information that we have is that it happened on the freeway,” he said.\nThe attack was believed to have taken place on a three-quarter-mile stretch of the northbound 5 Freeway, between Carmenita Road and Rosecrans Boulevard, investigators said.\nAfter being wounded, the men exited the freeway at Rosecrans Boulevard and drove east about a mile until they spotted an ambulance and sought help, officials said.\nNo description of the vehicle that contained the shooter or shooters was available, Dolson said. A motive was not clear.\nThe teenage victim, who was a passenger in the minivan, was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting at UCI Medical Center in Orange County, officials said.\nThe two other men who were wounded in the minivan were in their 20s and 30s, Dolson said. They were hospitalized in stable condition.\nCalifornia Highway Patrol officials shut down all northbound lanes of the freeway during the investigation, CHP Officer Francisco Villalobos said. Traffic was diverted off the freeway at Valley View Avenue.\nThe left lane of the northbound 5 Freeway was reopened at midnight, he said, and the remaining traffic lanes were opened shortly after 4 a.m.",

It’s that the Level of Refinement of her clothes isn’t in sync with her needs.\nSo, how refined is your wardrobe? One thing I should make clear: Refinement has nothing to do with how much you pay for an item, who makes it, nor with how classy (I really hate that word!) it is.\nMore about different levels within Business Wear here.\nShoes and clothing that you would wear camping in the woods, for painting the house or gardening, or for athletics fall into this last category, and stay within their own level.

    "text": "Unless you have been under a rock for the past few weeks, you will know Benefit has recently launched their new mascara – BADgal BANG mascara. It was very highly anticipated with Benefit spending millions on their marketing in the lead up and launch – taking bloggers to Maldives, hosting a massive launch party complete with Lisa Potter Dixon (head make-up artist for Benefit) in a space suit and countless amount of adverts and promotion all over social media. It claims to have massive volume without weighing down lashes, using a space technology which is ‘gravity-defying’. It is also said to lengthen lashes, give dramatic volume and instantly lift lashes, whilst also being smudge-proof and water-resistant.\nI have to say I was very disappointed! As I normally do every morning, I curled my eyelashes before applying Benefit’s BADgal BANG mascara. As I then applied it through my lashes the first thing that struck me was how wet the formula was. Applying as thin a layer as I could, I quickly saw my lashes fall from a beautiful curl to almost straight. Using my finger, I did try and push my lashes back into a lift as it dried but the formula was just too wet and heavy.\nOnce fully dry, although my lashes were not lifted they were thick and very black. They also didn’t feel heavy once dry which was frustrating. I think if you already have lovely lashes which do not need any help from eyelash curlers, this mascara could be perfect for you. If you have lashes like mine however, I would recommend to stay clear! I’m definitely going to stick to good old faithful L’Oreal False Lash Architect waterproof mascara, which you can see from the image above (excuse my goggly eyes!) it gives a much better lift to my lashes.\nHave you tried Benefit’s BADgal BANG mascara yet? What were your thoughts?",

Thus, we create masterpieces through the strategic manipulation of metal that is heated to malleability in the forge within a specific window of time.\nWe take pride in attending to the details of our work, as this is where our command of the expressive movement of metal is most evident.\nAlthough most people assume that blacksmithing leads to purely metal products, we often incorporate other materials, such as glass, stone, and wood, into the metal work. These combinations provide endless possibilities of what can be accomplished and styles that can complement the surrounding environment.\nThe final step involves choosing an appropriate finish that brings the details all together and completes the visual effect. The right finish is determined by the kind of product, it’s use (e.g., stand-alone visual sculpture versus tangible handrail), and where it is situated (i.e., indoor versus outdoor; level of humidity, etc.). There are a wide variety of finishes and their combinations that can be used, including hand and spray painting, patina, chemical processing, galvanizing, powder coating, etc.\nWe ensure that all work is delivered and installed safely and appropriately, and that all final touches are made on site.

It is the intellect displayed by machines perceiving its environment and taking actions to accomplish a goal. These virtual assistants use Natural Language Processing (NLP), an ability of the computers through which they can program itself to respond in real-world languages, to match user’s input.\nVarious companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter are using AI to track their visitor behaviour and accordingly show posts, comments, likes and shares on their feed. Similarly, e-commerce websites like Amazon and eBay track the browsing pattern of each user with the help of AI to reach out to its customers more efficiently.\nAs the use of predictive analysis, NLP, and computer vision is gaining momentum, here are some initial treads to incorporate AI into businesses.\nThere is an overwhelming effort needed in data preparation and exploration, largely due to data quality problems. Analyse your business process and visualise your data by using interactive dashboards and insight modules. Start with data-rich processes and a well-defined business case.\nTackle data challenges by employing solid platforms for data preparation, prediction and visualisation. Secure your data, yet keep it highly available to let the machine intelligence access it effectively.\nTake out the technicality of AI modelling by leveraging automated machine learning with best of breed algorithms.\nTo make up for lack of skills and shortage of data scientists or AI specialists, empower users of all skill types to quickly develop and deploy predictive models.

It’s a bit like having normal life in all the craziness. Photo shoots for me, are a time to just relax and let everything stop for a little while and enjoy a moment. Editing reminds me of how much I love photography and reassures me that when this time in life settles down, I’ll have a career I love.\nLast month I had the honor of capturing the tiny life of baby Augustine. He’s the third child of a wonderful woman we met when Amanda was a fit model for Billabong. Zinnia was one of the gals that fit all the swimsuits on Amanda for the designer. She was so great to us and we’ve managed to stay in touch over the years through Facebook. I photographed her daughter several years ago and now her son. Enjoy!\nI love to capture as many different facial expressions as I can. Augustine was so sweet and pleasant that he mostly just had a calm demeanor. A little smile here and there and sweet patience. He was the easiest and happiest little person.\nNext on my list is to capture all of the things I miss most about my own grown children. I love his tiny feet, neck, baby ears, and hands. I love to see the light shine through his tiny little ear that will one day grow into an adult ear. Oh, that baby body and little head with sweet fluffy hair. Childhood is so short and the people our children become is just a shadow of who they where when they were so small. It’s so important to save it.\nZinnia did a great job of packing different outfits so we could have several looks. I still can’t believe how tolerant Augustine was of all the changes.

The unit points to the ongoing Syrian conflict as a source of the increased threat.\nAccording to the Supo assessment, in spite of the increased risk of radical Islam fomenting terrorism, Finland is still not a primary target for terrorist organisations.\nThe security police add that the risk of al-Qaeda-led attacks against Finland or Finns is still low, even though around 40 people have travelled from Finland to Syria to join Islamist groups there.\nAccording to Tuomas Portaankorva of Supo there is an ongoing traffic of fighters between Finland and Syria, with some returning from the war and others going back to Syria after a break in Finland.\n\"They can take on a more radical world view than before,\" said Supo head Antti Pelttari.\nThe evaluation of an increased threat refers to violence that may be perpetrated within local borders without external guidance. Interior Minister Päivi Räsänen says that Finland has around 200 higher-risk individuals.\n\"We have more of those high risk individuals, they have more contact to extremist ideologies and extremist actions,\" said Räsänen. \"They have been there, received training. That's why this threat level has been raised.\"\nSupo said that there are more people in Finland with links to terrorist organisations. They unit reports increased numbers of people travelling to conflict areas in Syria as well as those who have returned from engaging in war tourism.\nAccording to Supo it has no information about concrete terrorism operations targeting Finland. However the intelligence organization has warned that the operations of networks with links to Syria and the activities of private individuals are unpredictable and difficult to anticipate.",

Today Fairfax is a quaint and friendly place to live, with restaurants and historic buildings that dot the city. There are weekly farmers markets, art galleries and historic buildings.

    "text": "Climbers are highly versatile plants with a natural tendency to climb, scramble or ramble. They are excellent for covering walls, fences, trellis, unsightly features or pergolas, or even to clamber over natural supports such as conifer trees, bushes and shrubs. Some climbers twine around the framework they're designed to scramble over, whereas others such as Hedera, Campsis and Passiflora actually self-cling to their climbing surface. The structure you use to support your climber should be secure and strong, because the plants can become heavy with age.\nClimbing plants can be used to brighten up your vertical planting areas such as bare walls or simply provide beautiful flowers, lush foliage and a fabulous scent for your garden. If you're looking for climbing plants for sun then Trachelospermum and Campsis are an excellent choice, whereas the best climbing plants for shade are Parthenocissus and Akebia Quinata (also known as Chocolate Vine). Many climbers are also excellent wildlife attracting plants, whilst Hedera varieties such as Hedera Hibernica make useful groundcover plants and Hedera Helix is suitable for growing in a container.",

I rented it from GameFly with great expectations, but unfortunately, I was disappointed.\nDon’t get me wrong. I think this is a decent game, but it just wasn’t good enough for me because I can not accept decent from Mario Party. After having had played Mario Party 8, in addition to the Mario Party series for the GameCube, I just expected something more… wow.\nThe game had similar elements to the other games in the series, which was fine, like the typical Nintendo characters and all that; however, the elements that were supposed to be different were the ones that I did not like. For example, not having minigames to play after every turn, and instead only playing the minigame when someone landed on it was something different. Personally, I did not like this because it became a game of repetition of who could go furthest the fastest. Then on the rare occasion that a minigame did pop up, I felt annoyed because it was wasting my time and got in the way of my reaching the star.\nThe game also just felt harder, which made it less fun. Rather than going for an attainable challenge, the game was more like luck by chance. Rather than being social, it was unsocial. There were less interactions with my competitors and rather it was a journey I mostly took alone.\nOut of the two Mario Party games for the Wii, Mario Party 8 wins by a landslide. Mario Party 9 did not live up to the standards it set for itself by coming no where near the epicness of its successors. I was very honestly disappointed and grateful that I did not purchase the game. Mario Party 10 for the Wii U comes out next year and I can only hope that it lives its legacy or is taken to completely new grounds.\nThe moral of the story – Mario Party 9 is a no.\nDid anyone else feel the same way? What are your thoughts on the game?",

Luckily, Nintendo is making it all better, confirming an April release for Xenoblade Chronicles exclusively for the New Nintendo 3DS XL (as well as the smaller New Nintendo 3DS in Europe *sob*).\nThe massive adventure has been shrunk down to fit on Nintendo's new flagship handheld, remade with brand-new 3D visuals. Xenoblade Chronicles will also take advantage of the dual-screen system by offering map and character data on the bottom screen, as well as allowing direct camera control by using the C-stick nubbin.\nNot much else is known about the anticipated re-release, but as soon as we find out more, we'll be the first to let you know.",

It concludes with a quote the media attributes to DeSantis, that people with cancer who could not get health insurance should “show up to the emergency room” for treatment.\nThe commercial does not mention Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum except in the fine-print disclosure at the end.\nThe 30-second spot “Everybody” begins running in major media markets Tuesday. It launches as Gillum, the Tallahassee Mayor, turns the focus of his message this week to health care issues, including health care insurance coverage.\nDeSantis’s campaign was not immediately available Tuesday to comment on it.\nThe ad officially is a “three-pack” ad, through which the state party is promoting three of its candidates, Gillum, Florida Chief Financial Officer nominee Jeremy Ring, and Florida Agriculture Commissioner nominee Nikki Fried.\nNonetheless, the ad was announced and promoted Tuesday morning by Gillum’s gubernatorial campaign.\nAlong the way the ad cites Time magazine, the AARP and CNN to back up its message that DeSantis opposes requiring insurance companies to provide coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\n“How can DeSantis lead Florida when he leaves Floridians behind?” the narrator concludes.",

    "text": "With the emergence of new compression standards such as High-Efficiency Video Compression (HEVC), offering a potential bit-rate reduction of up to 50 percent over H.264, 4K services and UHD TV are looming on the horizon. Broadcasters and service providers are now researching the technology requirements of delivering 4K content to a wide range of IP-based multi-platform services. To maintain quality as compression standards change, everyone along the broadcast chain needs to constantly measure the performance of the compression engines on which day-to-day operations depend. Any operation, large or small, from hardware/software designers to end user-producers who work with any kind of compression in SD, HD, and now UHD, should subjectively and objectively analyze compression performance to gauge how their technical and aesthetic choices will look and sound to both a professional end-user or a home audience.\nSince its founding in 2003, Video Clarity has proactively delivered video quality testing and analysis tools to support the current and emerging formats customers require, and 4K is no exception. The company’s core capabilities are based on the notion that testing and QC must take place not only after the content goes live, but before, with testing tools that can ingest video from any source and then play it back in every resolution for delivery to every screen. Video Clarity’s products form a testing and monitoring foundation that can handle a large array of original file formats, with the ability to record and play back content and provide a split-screen comparison of two video sequences up to 4K resolution at 60Hz.\nThe RTM series of real-time monitors and recorders for checking video and audio quality, A/V offset, loudness, and VANC data integrity.

It is not clear how much it might cost the Eagles to sign Gore.\nGore, 31, finished last season with 1,106 yards on 255 carries and four touchdowns. One of 13 running backs to gain more than 1,000 yards last season, he ranked 10th among backs in the NFL.\nGore ran behind one of the top offensive lines in the NFL. ProFootball Focus ranked the Niners' as the ninth-best unit in the league last season. The Eagles finished second overall on the list.\nHis 4.3 yards per carry average was nearly identical to McCoy's 4.2 yards per carry.\nGore had a season high 119 rushing yards and a 55-yard touchdown reception in the 49ers' Week 4 win over Eagles last season.\nHow much of the workload Gore will get next season remains to be seen. If he joins the team, it's likely he will be the most experienced player on the roster.\nThe Eagles' need for a running back increased when they traded McCoy last week. They have Chris Polk (who they tendered as an unrestriced free agent), Darren Sproles, Kenjon Barner and Matthew Tucker on the roster.\nThere were rumblings on Saturday that the team might be interested in New Orleans Saints running back Mark Ingram, but Ingram re-signed before being able to accept other offers.\nThe free agency period is expected to be a busy one for the Eagles, who have approximately $46 million in salary-cap space.",

    "text": "Known as the “caviar of beans”, flageolet beans are a type of bean that originated in France, sometime in the 1800s (the name “Flageolet” is actually a French name) and is currently cultivated in two main areas in the country - Brittany (north-west of France) and the Nord-Picardy region in France. It is little wonder then, that flageolet beans are considered to be a typically “French” bean, commonly used in French cuisine. It is often served with lamb and there are quite a number of popular flageolet-based French dishes such as “flageolets à la crème” (flageolet with cream), “flageolets au chorizo” (chorizo flageolet) and “gratin de flageolets” (flageolet gratin).\nThe beans come in a variety of colors and are named accordingly; Flageolet noir (black, “noir” = “black” in French), Flageolet jaune (yellow), Flageolet rouge (red), Flageolet blanc (white) and Flageolet vert (pale green). The last two types, i.e., the white and pale green varieties are the most popular and of these two, arguably the most popular is flageolet vert (the pale green variety), also known locally as “Chevrier vert”.\nThe fresh beans could be cooked immediately, similar to green peas. The dried beans however would have to be soaked before they are ready for cooking.",

    "text": "Being an important physical backbone of any industrial enterprise, an industrial infrastructure propels the growth of business by supporting critical operations. That is why when infrastructure shows even a telltale sign of deterioration, facility owners need to act quickly to remediate. And when damages occur to protective infrastructure coating systems, a skilled painting company is called in to implement timely rehabilitation. The early detection, assessment, and remediation by the painting company of any infrastructure damage not only avoids huge costs, it also ensures lesser interruption in business processes.\nInfrastructure damage may be rooted in a variety of causes. The painting company can pinpoint whether the presence of water or minute moisture quantities has led to fungal or microbial growth. The qualified painting company can also determine if erosion through the harsh scouring action of wind, air, and water have deteriorated the surface of the structure, or if improper ventilation has unbalanced humidity and temperature, causing condensation or dehydration of surfaces. A skilled painting company can determine whether chemical, physical, or corrosive attacks have undermined the integrity of the infrastructure.\nDuring everyday operations, any signs of damage such as peeling paint, cracks in walls and surfaces, deteriorating floor quality, leaky roofs, traces of moisture seepage, or fungal and microbial stains should raise a warning bell that it maybe time to call in a painting company for coatings rehabilitation.",

The new owner, who bought her for £100, took her to the vet, who discovered she had a microchip and had been stolen.\nMiss Arnold said she believes the thieves may not have realised Shammy is blind in one eye, as the dog has black fur around where its eye should be.\nShe added they are not suitable as house pets.\n“They are farm dogs,” she explained.\nWhite Horse Lane is not an often-used thoroughfare and so the owners believe that the dogs have been deliberately targeted.\nShammy is black and tan, with ears that stand up. She also has a docked tail.\nMiss Arnold said: “It’s heartbreaking that they have been taken.\n“We were supposed to go to Berlin next week and obviously we have now had to cancel. If someone finds them, please call the dog warden.\n“We will give a reward of £300 for the dogs and if someone has bought them we will give them their money back.\"\nAnyone finding the dogs can call Miss Arnold on (0118) 973 5115 or 07738 352150.",

Wondering when this hot tradition started? back in the Prehispanic times, Incas and Pre-Inca cultures loved chili: no refrigerators available made this product a good way to increase or dissimulate certain undesired flavors, another great reason is that this product is a great bactericide, they possibly got to understand that by eating it and feeling less incidence of stomach ache and started to use it regularly since then, today’s people of the most remote communities of this nation still use this natural remedy as a great condiment to their food.\nIf you want my advice: try it but in moderation… a tiny spoon first and the more if your tongue can resist it.\nP.s.

What?s going to happen next? Can the Executive branch ignore these committee subpoenas?\nIt certainly can try, and a showdown between Congress and the Executive may lie ahead. Having shrouded the program in secrecy for over five years and fought oversight in the traditional court system, the Administration is likely to keep trying to avoid meaningful Congressional oversight as well.\nIn a recent post at the Balkinization blog, Marty Lederman outlines the Senate's options for enforcing compliance. The law in this area remains unclear, and past clashes between Congress and the Executive over legislative access to \"national security\" documents have been resolved by settlement, not judicial decision. The Justice Department has routinely insisted that these documents could not be shared with a Congressional committee, but has had to abandon its claim to Exclusive power over what to release.\nThis fight might not be easy for Congress, but it must stand firm and fulfill its Constitutional duty. Disclosure of the requested documents could be a critical step toward revealing the full extent of the NSA's illegal spying and the role that telecommunications companies like AT&T played in it. The American public deserves to know the truth about the program, and Congress should, to the fullest extent, use its powers to make the Executive comply.\nYou can help, too, by showing your support for Congress' investigation now.\nUpdated, 7/18: Apparently, the Judiciary Committee has agreed to delay the deadline.",

    "text": "The Valley is the first book in Helen Bryan’s exciting new historical fiction trilogy. I found this book to be thoroughly enjoyable and captivating.\nThe story begins with Sophie Grafton, the heroine, as a child. She’s an English Viscount’s spoiled daughter, who is horribly obstinate and impossible to control. The Viscount paid Sophie’s care-givers exorbitant salaries just to keep them from quitting. Although, Sophie did eventually grow to be a beautiful and charming young lady, she never did lose her stubborn, bossy streak.\nThe story intensifies after Sophie, discovers, to her horror, that her beautiful home is no longer hers. To avoid becoming a pauper, Sophie is forced to travel to America to claim her father’s land in Virginia. After many tiresome months of treacherous travel, Sophie is shocked and devastated by the condition of her so-called Virginia homestead.\nThe author does an exceptional job describing life as a pioneer, in the 1700’s. I felt as if I was in the story, with the characters, wandering through the wilderness, enduring harsh winters, guarding against wild animals, and fearing Indian raids.\nI found The Valley to be well-written, compelling and humorous. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.",

After Martel rewrote the coming-of-age playbook a decade ago in Argentina with La cienaga, Said is late to the same game in neighbouring Chile, where teen girl Manena (Francisca Walker) witnesses the alienation between her landowner family and the indigenous workers waging what appears to be full-on rebellion on the family’s southern woodlands property. While the key to both films is the point-of-view from an upper-class perspective, there’s a crucial difference: Martel allowed space for her working-class characters to gain considerable power in the interstices of her elliptical narrative; Said falls into the trap of abstracting everyone outside the obnoxious family circle, rendering the brewing war on the film’s borders to the scale of a negligible skirmish at best. The gorgeous rendering of the lushly forested landscapes begins to play the unfortunate role of covering over the movie’s extremely slim and obvious content, in which each family member plays their proscribed and predictable role, down to Manena’s dad as a deluded mini-caudillo.",

I couldn’t explain this, and for a while, it troubled me. I felt strange, especially in my younger years. Over time, I’ve come to accept this part of myself, and do my best to nurture it.

He encapsulates the reason for writing and creating so very well.\nThese verses define what I’m about, as both a writer and a speaker; the ministry of reminding- of restating truths we already know. I do this always, and I will do it as long as I am around, so that even after I’ve departed, the memory of truth will live on. I hope what I write is fresh, but there is nothing original. It’s all just a reminder.\nThat’s why I do what I do…to remember.\nAnd sometimes in writing, we relearn or rehear something that God is trying to say.

The local communities are directly dependent on natural resources for their livelihood. They derive their food, clothing, fuel, medicines and shelter form bio-resources. Thus the economy, identity and cultural and spiritual values of the people are closely linked with biological diversity and natural ecosystems. Human interference in the from of habitat destruction, overexploitation, poaching, introduction of exotics, fragmentation of biodiversity rich areas etc. have, however, scaled up ongoing reduction in biodiversity accompanied with loss to genetic diversity, thus resulting in a threat to very existence of human being on the earth.This unwarranted situation has drawn the attention of the entire “world community”. The “International Convention on Biodiversity” came in to existence because of this grave situation. The state of Rajasthan has issued ‘Rajasthan Biological Rules, 2010’ under the provisions of ‘Biological Diversity Act 2002’ enacted by Government of India to conserve the biological resources and to ensure their sustainable use as also to equitably share benefits among the various stakeholders. Rajasthan State Biodiversity Board has been constituted for this very purpose and will act as catalyst. Nevertheless, active support and cooperation of the whole society is indispensable for this noble cause.I specially urge that we proactively support our “local bodies” i.e. Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis, Zila Parishads, Municipal Boards, Municipal Councils and Municipal Corporation,who shoulder,along with the Rajasthan State Biodiversity Board, the actual responsibility of conserving biological resources. Let us resolve to work together to conserve biodiversity so that all forms of life can coexist amicably on this beautiful planet.",

She approached the owner of the store in a most humble manner and asked if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that her husband was very ill and unable to work, they had seven children and they needed food. The grocer scoffed at her and requested that she leave his store.\nVisualizing the family needs, she said: “Please, sir! I will bring you the money just as soon as I can.” The Grocer told her he could not give her credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store. Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her family.\n“O.K.” he said, “put your grocery list on the scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that amount in groceries.” The lady, hesitated a moment with a bowed head, then she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled something on it. She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head still bowed.\nThe eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the scales went down and stayed down. The grocer, staring at the scales, turned slowly to the customer and said begrudgingly, “I can’t believe it.” The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no more. The grocer stood there in utter disgust.\nFinally, he grabbed the piece of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement. It was not a grocery list; it was a prayer which said: “Dear Lord, you know my needs and I am leaving this in your hands.” The grocer gave her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in stunned silence.",

If you just keep moving, you will get to a lot of clubs, but if you try to “force” going to the clubs in a specific order, you may end up seeing less music and spending more time riding on buses. We will always send you to the clubs at the time when they are scheduled to have music, not before. It doesn’t do any good to get to a club before the band does.\n2. Earlier is better, get the earliest departure time you can and then move up if you can via “stand-by”. If there’s an empty seat — get on the bus!\n3. If the club you’ve arrived at is overcrowded — get back on the bus and try to come back later! Same thing if it looks like the band is not getting ready to start.\n4.

You should try to start working you way toward your final destination at midnight, which is when the buses start making their final trips.

    "text": "Planting trees: it is best to plant the shade tree first if phasing the project and then plant the ornamental trees later. Each tree hole should be at least 2 feet larger in diameter than its root ball. After the hole is dug, its a good idea to fill the hole with water to see how well the soil drains, depending on the type of tree. If the water stays in the hole for more than 2 days, you may have a drainage issue. Gravel might be inserted to help with the problem.\nSweetgum tree planting tip: Do not plant in rock; do not plant on steep slopes and give them plenty of water. They can be kept alive and semi healthy in rock, but a regular application of sulphur and chelated iron is needed in some cases. The sweetgum tree can be self pruning as well.\nHabit: Fast-growing junk tree. Large varying shaped leaves. Very shallow and destructive root system. Smooth bark.\nCulture: Grows anywhere - requires a ton of water.\nUses: None of redeeming value.\nNotes: This is one of the most overplanted trees in Texas!

It is really encouraging because it very much describes what I have been studying through Taimyo Kata.\nDecember 7 and December 10 will be here soon. December 7, 1941, is when Japanese naby attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and December 10, 1937, is when the Japanese army in China invaded Nanjing in China (the “Nanjing massacre”).",

A middle aged preacher by the name of Janus Januson and his assistant Isaiah Herdship were convinced that the heroes were willing to learn more about the faith, despite possibly being slightly mentally unstable and heavily cloaked.\nWhen the party was brought back to the cult lair, Janus initiated a baptismal ceremony for the party. Our heroes, thinking on their feet, dumped their baptismal tub of scalding water over Melhavoc and themselves rather than expose their disguises by putting their hands in the tub.\nValthrun collapsed the entrance of the cult complex and had servitors attempt to kill the PCs. The PCs teleported back into the compound and had a final show-down with Valthrun, but not before resurrecting and then re-killing Isaiah to fuel one of Valthrun’s teleportation portals.\nValthrun died in a fit of hurbris, unable to grasp on to the ledge of his platform, plummeting to the ground.",

They can also be used for taking, sending and viewing pictures of the damage to the front of the eye or eyelids.\nThe study was conducted among some 350 patients who reported issues like headaches, eyesight changes and similar vision problems in emergency rooms.\nThe study also included the inner-eye photos taken by the ER staff using an ocular camera.\nThen the study team assessed the response of two ophthalmologists who viewed and rated the pictures on a desktop PC and did the same on an iPhone.\nThe results of the study, published in the Archives of Ophthalmology, show that the doctors found the iPhone images good or better than desktop images and rated them high.\nWhile one ophthalmologist felt 53 pictures were of the same quality, he found 46 better on iPhone and just one was better on PC.\nFor the other ophthalmologist who participated in the study, 56 were of equal quality, while 42 were better on iPhone leaving only two better on PC.\nThe study team thinks that it is possible that smartphones can be used in ophthalmic treatment as a new tool with which hospital staff can send the photos from the ER to the doctor’s smartphone for consultation. And later maybe, somebody can make an app for that.\nThe team is planning to extend its study about this possibility.",

    "text": "Let’s take a moment to map out a cheap and effective social media strategy. Understand that cheap does not mean easy. This will take a dedicated effort and a lot of hours. But those hours could be more valuable than a high-priced advertising campaign.\nIt is imperative that you recognize the difference between communicating and selling. Never sell. Just listen, help, and tell. If you advertise via social media, your audience will not welcome you and you will not be effective. Build relationships and the sales will follow.\nThink of social media as the world’s largest cocktail party. You are there to mix, mingle, and work the room. You can hand out business cards but don’t personally try to sell anything. If people understand you and are impressed by your knowledge, they may take a look at your business card and decide to give you a call.\nPeople are more comfortable buying from someone they know, respect, and trust. The purpose of your blog is to build credibility. You can post links to your blog on social media sites. A couple of blogging platforms I recommend are WordPress and Tumblr.\nWhile you are working on Step Two, get your social media accounts set up and start lurking. Lurking is the equivalent of “working the room” at the cocktail party. Listen before diving into the conversations on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.\nOnce you have enough content on your blog to make it interesting, you can start participating in the conversation. Engaging, humorous or insightful answers and posts will drive people to your blog. Your blog will carry the branding and information about your online store.\nMany online merchants find the concept of social media to be foreign and uncomfortable. But social media is a direct to consumer tool that gives small businesses marketing power equal to their larger competitors. Put aside your reservations and start using it. With hard work and the basic guidelines I’ve outlined, you can increase your online sales and build a more prosperous business.",

The case study is built from a series of interviews which took place over this four year period and a smaller collection of Ken’s diary entries. The paper focuses on the changes in Ken’s perceptions and beliefs about language and language learning throughout this time, tracing his transition from a learner to user of English; from ideas about learning through repetition and hard work to ‘learning by doing’ and his ‘negotiation of identity’ (Block, 2003) in his new language contexts. The destabilisation of Ken’s previous beliefs about himself as a learner and about the nature of language are seen to trigger some of these changes. The paper concludes with discussion of the generalisability of the findings to learners from Confucian Heritage Cultures and the implications for pre-sessional teaching/syllabus design.",

I have been using moisturizer since the age of 12 and now that I am almost 50 I like to change it up with new products that my skin need to get used to.\nI love the bottle with the see through sides. The Ultra Spa Skin Care moisturizer definitely is non-greasy and easily glides over and absorbs into the skin.\nAfter using the moisturizer for one week I feel like the fine lines above my lip are less definitive and the crows feet around the outside of my eyes are less noticeable unless I smile and there is nothing wrong with smiling. This is a great addition to my morning skin routine. It has a nice pleasant scent that isn't heavy.\nThis is one of the best anti aging skin cream I have used to date.\nI'm always looking for a good moisturizer. I have diabetic dry skin, so I'll try anything that might help, lol. I'll look into this one!\nSounds good- would love o try this one!",

This means that BACH will no longer exist as a program within its fiscal sponsor, Health Resources in Action (HRiA), but its staff will remain as HRiA employees.\nOver the years, BACH has been a part of many crucial citywide public health initiatives. It partnered with the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) to complete the community-wide strategic planning process, Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP), to better understand the needs and assets of Boston residents. It helped to catalyze the creation of the Boston CHNA/CHIP Collaborative, the first citywide assessment and improvement plan. And in partnership with BPHC and a dozen community organizations, BACH trained and mobilized nearly 80 residents as grassroots advocates and health educators.\nWith these successes has come landscape change. Historically, as the local Community Health Area Network (CHNA), BACH played a role in the distribution of community funding from hospitals. State Department of Public Health regulations have changed this process, deemphasizing CHNAs and creating a more accessible and transparent opportunity for community entities to connect directly with hospitals and create partnerships. This is an equitable shift and a credit to everyone who pushed for this change. As the funding landscape has evolved, so too have community organizations’ cross-sector partnerships and resource access.\nThank you to our partners and stakeholders. We hope that you will continue to carryout BACH’s mission and vision of healthier and more equitable City.",

    "text": "Basement water proofing is one of the most important home improvements you can make. Just like preventing water from coming in through your roof, preventing water and moisture coming in through the foundation, will increase the value of your home. Home buyers are very skiddish about water in basements and is often one of the first areas of concern they express.\nToday, there are very real measures we take to prevent seepage and a damp smell that so many basements have. But, it doesn’t have to be that way. Many older homes did not properly provide for water drainage around the foundation because basements were not finished and were primarily used for storage. Today, they are often finished adding additional living space to the home’s footprint. That’s why you may be having water issues in your basement.\nTo create proper drainage from the ground surrounding your foundation, we use 5 methods. You may already have 1 or 2 of these in place and may still be experiencing water penetration. If so, consider adding more options to make your home drier.\nPipes or gravel placed inside the trench will create a barrier with the foundation.\nLeaders need to be angled properly so water moves away from house.\nThis type of drain removes water from the yard.\nInstalling sump pumps keeps water from rising around the foundation.",

It resulted in the destruction of the Polish forces.\nThe battle can be divided into two phases - from 17 to 20 September and from 21 to 26 September. In the first phase (also known as the First Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski), Polish forces were composed of Army Lublin and Army Kraków under general Tadeusz Piskor attempted to break through the German positions around Tomaszów towards the Romanian Bridgehead area. The Polish forces included one of the largest Polish armored units of that time, the Warsaw Armoured Motorized Brigade. This phase ended with the capitulation of the Army Lublin on 20 September.\nThe second phase (also known as the Second Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski) involved Polish units from the so-called Northern Front - remaining elements of Army Lublin, Army Modlin and Operational Groups Wyszków, Narew and Anders Cavalry under generals Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski and Stefan Dąb-Biernacki. Similarly, those Polish units attempted to break through the German positions towards the south. Only the cavalry group under general Władysław Anders was successful; most of the remaining Polish forces failed to break through and capitulated around 26 September.\nAs Polish reports mention – on 18th of September Polish forces near Tomaszów Lubelski were attacked by around 80 German tanks from 2. Panzer-Division from direction Rawa Ruska – Tomaszow Lubelski – it was during the biggest Panzer-battle of September campaign, which took place between 17th and 20th of September (around 100 Polish AFVs versus around 100 German AFVs).",

    "text": "Roman Road is delighted to be participating at NADA New York this year with a solo booth by Antony Cairns. Bringing together selected pieces from two of his most recent series – IBM and E.I. – our booth will look at how Cairns has evolved unique ways of printing and exhibiting his images of cities at night, reappropriating recycled materials and outdated technologies into new forms that expand the possibilities of photography today.\nCairns’ IBM series presents his abstract photographs printed on coloured IBM computer cards. For Cairns, these cards mirror his imagery of cities; each has a repetitive sequence of numbers on one side while his photographs often focus on the patterns and continual progression found in metropolitan areas. Each section of the chosen image is inkjet printed onto individual cards, which are then assembled and hand-pinned by the artist onto wood before being enclosed in a Perspex frame. The booth features a collection of never before seen works from this series, each composed of 70 cards.\nWith his E.I. series, Cairns has taken the idea of photographic printing to new levels, creating works that present his dystopian city scenes petrified in e-reader screens. While plugged into the computer, the selected image is uploaded to a salvaged e-reader, left untouched and then disconnected. The screen is then taken apart from the device, halting any interference from the electronic impulses that could alter the display and leaving a lasting image. These unique works are similarly encapsulated in Perspex frames. Among his large-scale composite IBM works, a selection of Cairns’ E.I. works displaying his recent photographs taken in Tokyo are presented upon shelves in the stand.",

The documentary that resulted, appropriately titled Thin, gives an intimate look at a disorder that effects up to 3.7% of the U.S. female population.\nThin is essentially an hour and a half of weigh-ins, family therapy, group therapy, and treatment progress reports. While this may leave viewers feeling weary and depressed, Greenfield clearly wanted audiences to experience the struggles of anorexia and to highlight the difficulty of recovery.\nHigh fashion model Kate Moss was once quoted as saying, \"Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.\" This quote has become the motto of the anorexic community, which accentuates the cognitive distortions that go hand in hand with the illness. For this reason, family and friends play a large role in enabling eating disordered behavior or supporting recovery by setting clear boundaries and encouraging weight gain.\nI highly recommend this documentary for the purpose of education on the behaviors, symptoms, and struggles of anorexic and eating disordered individuals.",

Steps to body odour free summer!\nDIY 5 Steps to no smelly armpits!\nBegin with a good body wash that leaves you smelling like vanilla or cherry or any other fragrance you like. With so many types of body washes available in the market, you can pick something that suits your skin type and also fights germs that cause odour.\nDo not skip the towel dry step, pat your skin with a clean towel and stay dry to avoid any fungal infections and bad body odour.\nMoisture in the skin leads to a lot of skin trouble and also to odour since the folds of the skin become the breeding ground for fungus and other germs.\nAlways air out your wet towels and make sure they are washed off any germs and dust frequently.\nUse a good roll on deodorant, I recommend a roll on over a spray because if you like using perfume, the roll on won't overtake the fragrance of the perfume.\nRub the roll on generously on your underarms, behind your knees and any other areas prone to more sweating.\nThere are some good roll on deodorants available in the market, you can pick between brands like Nivea and Dove.\nIf you like spray deodorants and can’t afford a perfume, skip the roll on. Make sure you spray the deodorant on your body and not on your clothes.\nAfter STEP 3 , cut the chase to step 5.\nApply a little Vaseline on your wrists, behind your ears and then wear your perfume , the Vaseline will lock in the undertones of your perfume and make sure you keep smelling fabulous all day long.\nThis is a must try tip to make your perfume last longer. Use these 5 steps and have a refreshing and odour free summer.

Now Ferguson takes a turn as a washed-up '80s rock relic - Scottish variety - boozing his days away in the lush folds of a Welsh country manse. Lest that sound like thin situation comedy, he plays his own director, too. But the less said about his fiddle-dee-dee assortment of wipes, picture-within-picture montages and boxy framing and editing the better. Most likely his intended audience won't be setting down their knitting to pass such carping judgments. For Ferguson's secret weapon is his first time co-star, warbling Welsh 'angel' Charlotte Church. Zipping about in a pretty pink scooter and helmet ensemble, she plays the cherubic fatherless daughter of small town hairdresser Jemma Redgrave, who lives down the road from Ferguson's estate (and its dormant recording studio) and bears him an unaccountable grudge. Similarly, she hasn't a lot of time for her old man, Joss Ackland, a leatherbound rock'n'roll recalcitrant who's parked his tour bus on their doorstep. There's also Brown, genially low key as Ferguson's old drummer pal; and McNeice as a slimy record exec with halitosis, the closest the film comes to a source of dramatic tension.",

    "text": "This study investigated the effectiveness of equating with very small samples using the random groups design. Of particular interest was equating accuracy at specific scores where performance standards might be set. Two sets of simulations were carried out, one in which the two forms were identical and one in which they differed by a tenth of a standard deviation in overall difficulty. These forms were equated using mean equating, linear equating, unsmoothed equipercentile equating, and equipercentile equating using two through six moments of log-linear presmoothing with samples of 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200. The results indicated that identity equating was preferable to any equating method when samples were as small as 25. For samples of 50 and above, the choice of an equating method over identity equating depended on the location of the passing score relative to examinee performance. If passing scores were located below the mean, where data were sparser, mean equating produced the smallest percentage of misclassified examinees. For passing scores near the mean, all methods produced similar results with linear equating being the most accurate. For passing scores above the mean, equipercentile equating with 2- and 3-moment presmoothing were the best equating methods. Higher levels of presmoothing did not improve the results.",

The key to cooking that tempts and satisfies, that brings people to the table, then brings them back for more, is understanding flavors and how they work together.\nAnd while a culinary degree certainly helps one understand this, more important is a willingness to try new foods, as well as old foods in new combinations. Now there is a book to help you take that flavorful trip.\nFlavor masters Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg have compiled an encyclopedic primer to flavor. Their just-released \"The Flavor Bible\" not only explains what foods taste like, it also offers exhaustive lists of flavor pairings for each.\nThey suggest mascarpone, for example, which goes nicely with almonds, ladyfingers and peaches, among many other options. They also suggest pairings to avoid, such as maple syrup and brown sugar (too intense).\nThe first two sections of the book explain how flavor works and offer advice from chefs and others about how they pair various flavors to create great recipes.\nIt's one of the rare cookbooks without recipes that everyone should learn to cook from.",

Additionally, some of the different factors that exist when referring to diversity include age, culture, gender, national origin, race, religious beliefs, and sexual preference.\nWith this in mind, there are many examples that can be shared in reference to your own personal experiences from your working environment as well as the examples that were discussed from the assigned reading. There are certainly a number of examples that those in the workforce are familiar with as it relates to diversity in the workforce. However, even with the realization of the importance of diversity in the workforce, there continues to be some challenges that many continue to face as a result of diversity. There is also the perspective of some organizations experiencing the feeling of being “burned out,” especially with some of the challenges experienced by some companies where managers are not fully committed.\nThat being said, based on your experiences, why do you think so many companies find increasing and managing diversity to be a difficult and sometimes challenging task?",

And yet, it’s apparently going to be real thing!\nAccording to Fox Sports Australia, Dellavedova and his Australian manager Bruce Kaider have teamed up with Los Angeles producers Zachary Green and Jason Shuman to create a film about Delly’s life. It will focus on his upbringing in Australia and lead right up into the present day, which has taken Dellavedova to the magical city of...Milwaukee. No, but seriously, Kaider is promising that there will be plenty of intriguing stops along the way.\n\"Delly’s inspirational story about overcoming the odds is one everyone can relate to,\" Kaider said in a press release, according to Fox Sports Australia. \"In real life, it played out just like a movie.\"\nDellavedova added that he’s looking forward to getting started on the film. \"I am honored that Bruce, Zachary, and Jason think enough about my journey to turn it into a feature film,\" he said. \"I am thrilled to be working with this incredible group to tell my story to inspire kids around the world to dream big and that hard work and perseverance pays off.\"\nThe press release about the biopic suggested the filmmakers are going to try and emulate movies like Hoosiers and Rocky when they create the film, which seems like it’ll be an impossible task. But then again, Delly is a guy who most people hadn&apos;t even heard of until 2015, and he somehow managed to finesse a four-year, $38 million contract this past offseason and now a movie about his life. So clearly, anything is possible!\nStay tuned for more details about the biopic.",

When she wasn't talking about her dream of becoming an author, she wrote stories and began honing her skills at an early age.\nMelanie's father was a Scottish national. He came to Canada as a 'Home Child' through the auspices of The Orphan Homes of Scotland. She promised herself that one day her feet would touch the soil in her father's homeland. That first trip was in 1993 and she's not looked back since, having returned to the auld country a further eleven times and is looking forward to trip number twelve. On one of her many trips to Scotland, Melanie had the honour of meeting Princess Anne (The Princess Royal) at the orphanage where her father was raised.\nEncouraged to study Highland Dancing, she competed locally. Her final competition took place during the summer of 1969, a few short months after her father's death, at the 1000 Islands Highland Games. In that last event- she won the Silver Medal in the Sword Dance.\nOther works by Melanie include a compilation of short stories, The Consequences Collection ; a children's chapter book geared to ages 7-11, Tim's Magic Christmas; and a short novel set in a fictitious Eastern Canadian haunted house, The Secret of Hillcrest House. Her short story, Cole's Notes, was included in EFD1: Starship Goodwords, published by Carrick Publishing, 2012.\nThe sequel to her debut novel, Shadows From Her Past, came out in the summer of 2016. She released her latest novel, YESTERDAY TODAY ALWAYS, in September 2017.\nWhen she's not sequestered in her cave writing, plotting or editing, you'll find her out about. In addition to writing- she loves to travel- prowl through cemeteries (the older the better)- and photography.\nCole's Notes has been re-edited and will soon be released as a free read through her website and blog.",

Websites, social media, print ads, editorial profiles, annual reports and more all create an important impression about your business. Its vital that the first impression you create is a positive one, and high quality photography is an important element of that.\nThe general public are becoming increasingly visually sophisticated. Everyone can take a mediocre picture on their phone these days, so if you're going to have headshots of your key people visible to the public, then they'd better be good ones, or that first impression will suffer.\nI offer high quality headshots for your business, produced efficiently and with the minimum of fuss, at a realistic price. Yes, you might be able to find someone cheaper, or you could try and do them yourself, but, as with anything in life, you generally get what you pay for.\nI understand that you have a business to run, and that having pictures taken is taking people away from their work, so I work quickly and efficiently to make it as painless as possible. All you need to do is provide a space for me to work in.\nI bring everything I need to turn that space into a temporary photo studio.

This week get got some details of some of the new improvements and changes via the latest copy of Game Informer.\n-Bearded drawf guy is Salvador, the Gunzerker. Special ability is Dual-wielding. Any weapon can be dual-wield.\n-The original Vault Hunters will be support NPC’s.\n-Bandits now have their own brand of weaponry.\n-Weapons can have custom decals and enhancements.\n-Enemies are more responsive, and actually interact with each other better.\n-The players will also have interacting dialogues, similar to those in Left 4 Dead.\n-BL2’s skill tree will maintain the 3 Branch system and have more defined abilities rather than simple stat boosts. It is unknown how many skills will occupy each branch.\n-2 Gunzerker Skills were mentioned. One, increases the fire rate of any weapon the longer the trigger is held down. A second, while Dual-wielding, increases accuracy with same class weapons, or doubles damage for different class weapons.\nThat’s a whole lot of awesome right there.",

    "text": "European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer is learning Chinese in preparation for a potential trip to the future Chinese Space Station, and looking forward to eating Chinese food in space.\nESA regularly sends astronauts to the International Space Station, but the lack of launch capability means taking a ride with other space-faring nations, and in the future that could include China.\n\"Europe has no proper capsule to fly to space so we always need to have a rocket and to be invited by another nation. Currently we fly on a Soyuz rocket, so everyone who flies on a Soyuz rocket needs to learn Russian,\" Maurer said in an ESA WebTV interview at the Berlin Air and Space Show on April 27.\n\"In the future we might fly to the new Chinese Space Station, and of course, if you want to fly with the Chinese you need to learn Chinese.\"\nAsked by interviewer Kelsea Brennan-Wessels if he likes Chinese food, Maurer replied: \"It&apos;s brilliant, so I would love to have Chinese food in space\".\nIn August 2017, Maurer and ESA colleague Sam Cristoforetti travelled to China for joint sea survival training off the coast of Shandong Province.\nThe exercises were part of growing cooperation between the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSE) and ESA in human spaceflight that could one day see Europeans fly with Chinese to the Chinese Space Station.\nMaurer is also a part of Spaceship EAC, a programme in which students and scientists work together to tackle future space exploration challenges. The initiative, which he also introduces in the interview, includes preparing astronauts and technology for missions to the Moon.\nHe is close to finishing basic and pre-assignment training, and waiting for a mission to the International Space Station.\nConstruction of China&apos;s space station is expected to start around 2020 with the launch of the Tianhe core module and be completed by around 2022 with the addition of two further 20 metric tonne experiment modules, Wentian and Mengtian.",

    "text": "This CD represents my original music composing for solo piano in the last few years. Lots have been going on with my life- it’s all here in the music! Songs for my father, our beloved dog, Sadie, our cat, an Americana piece, a couple of orchestral pieces condensed for piano, and some wonderful eclectic solo piano pieces to inspire the listener and challenge the pianist! I’ve paid close attention to arrange these songs so they highlight the beautiful sound of solo piano!\nI have never awarded “Album of the Year” status to one recording because I always have several favorites for the year, but I think I’m going to have to make an exception with Mike Strickland’s Fantasy. My one-word review of this incredible solo piano album is “WOW!!!” Mike Strickland has performed in concert at my house twice and I’ve been listening to his music for years (this is his twenty-second release), so I know what an amazing pianist/composer he is, but Fantasy still took me by surprise. Even the sound quality of the album is superlative with a warmth that is never too bright even at the top end of the piano. Strickland did it all on this recording – compose, perform, record, engineer, mix, master and produce – and again, I am blown away. Strickland is incredibly versatile – from jazz to classical to new age, pop and everything in between – and this album has a really nice mix of styles that maintain a wonderful mood while showcasing a broad range of what he can do at the piano. (There are no blues or boogie tunes this time, but if that’s what you crave, check out Strickland’s 2011 Mississippi Boy!). I’ve been listening to this album while working on the computer and in the evening while doing some quiet odds and ends, and while it provides a rich backdrop, this isn’t music that stays in the background – it’s too good for that and needs to be savored and appreciated.",

The thrill of spending time together on view air does indeed wonders for strengthening individuals family bonds.\nChildren love camping. It’s this kind of adventure on their behalf, especially if they’re involved (or sometimes imagine that they’re) for making decisions and assisting with general everyday tasks.\nIn my opinion, family camping holidays are excellent fun if you are planning ahead. When the kids become bored and you’ve got no ideas on how to proceed, you are in danger!\nListed here are seven tips to make family camping more enjoyable.\nIt isn’t always the caliber of the play area that’s important. The play area is a vital “meeting point” that draws all of the children inside a campground. Before very long, your kids will gladly spend their hrs playing in the play area using their newly discovered buddies.\nThis can be a good method to slow things lower within the hour before bed time.\nLet the creativity flow together with your cooking and involve the kids in preparing the meals. The web is a superb supply of ideas just for fun items to prepare and eat when outdoors.\nChildren like to feel that they’re assisting and positively adding to things. Encourage them to contain the tent rods when establishing the tent, for instance. Simple such things as this can have them really excited and insert them in a good mindset throughout the trip.\nAlthough the kids are playing in the play area, sit lower, have a look around and identify 10 places visible out of your tent that you could describe by means of an idea. Write each clue in writing and conceal each one of these consequently at one sector you’ve identified.\nYou’ll be able to sit down lower, relax watching your kids getting time of the lives exercising the clues and moving in one place to another.\nIdeally, you will see enough to complete on-site. However, it’s worth searching for other things to do further an area, if the weather have a turn for that worse, for instance.\nIn case your children love the shore, locate a campground near a seaside – apparent really, but a little bit of planning will reap dividends.",

If you have fewer things, make them good.\n3. Sometimes you will not be prepared…and it’s okay.\nAmericans in particular like to be prepared for the worst-case-scenario, having separate cookie cutters for Christmas and Halloween. We seldom consider how negligible the consequences are when we run out of something or are unprepared. Nor do we consider how high the consequences are for being over-prepared: creating more money, space, upkeep and mental clutter.\nI’ve been working toward applying these basic principles to my life this year, through my Love List goal Less in 2012. So far, we’ve had two garage sales and donated a large quantity of “stuff” to charity. There is a lot more to do, however.\nWhy exactly do you own what you own?\nWhat could you get rid of and not miss?\nDo I really still need that?\nIf I do buy this, will it last? Is it high quality?\nIf I end up not needing it any longer, what is the re-sale value? If it's not sellable, would a charity take it? If not, what kind of impact does throwing it out have on the environment?\nI’m pretty confident these three questions will help you buy quality, needed things and have a minimal impact on the environment. None of these questions will work, though, if you aren’t completely honest with yourself.\nAre you working toward a more minimalist lifestyle? If so, share your experience in the comments.",

All four periods of Democratic control came between 2007 and 2015, with Democrats controlling as many as 57 seats between 2009 and 2011. However, Republicans were able to regain control of the Senate in 2015 and have held it ever since.\nAs of October 30 the model is predicting that the most likely outcome in the Senate is maintenance of the status quo — Republicans holding 51 seats and Democrats occupying 49. However, due to the wide range of possibilities, this outcome still has relatively low probability with a 17.4% chance. Interestingly, the model predicts that any outcome that falls between Democrats gaining two seats to Democrats losing three seats has a greater than 9% chance of happening.\nCook uses four different qualifiers to rate races: solid, likely, lean, or toss-up. If a seat is solid Republican or Democrat, Cook judges that it is highly likely that it will be won by that party. Conversely, if a seat is a toss-up, either party has a good chance of winning. Currently, Republicans have a slight edge as five of the nine toss-ups are for seats currently held by Democrats. Furthermore, Cook rates the North Dakota Senate Race, a seat currently held by Democrat Heidi Heitkamp, as lean Republican. In recent weeks Cook made headlines when it moved New Jersey Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez’s seat into toss-up. This comes despite strong polling for Menendez, who currently has a Real Clear Politics average lead of 6.5% in the polls and has a 90% chance of winning according to FiveThirtyEight.\nAs of October 30 Heitkamp, was down an average of 14% to her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer. The last poll to give Heitkamp an advantage came in February. On the other side of the aisle, while Dean Heller currently has an average lead of 1.7%, the race is effectively a dead heat, as his lead over Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen falling well within the margin of error.",

    "text": "Wrong-way crashes can produce catastrophic injuries | Breslin & Breslin, P.A.\nHead-on crashes mean that two vehicles going full speed smash each other. The impact of this is much greater than a similar accident involving two vehicles that are going the same way. When you are traveling in the same direction as the car that slams into you, the force of the impact will be reduced a bit.\nIn some cases, head-on wrecks are fatal. Even if the victims don't pass away from the injuries, there is a good chance that they will have to deal with negative impacts like catastrophic injuries. These include spinal and brain damage that can leave lifelong impacts on the person.\nPeople who are involved in a wreck with a wrong-way driver might decide to seek compensation. This can help negate the horrible financial aspects of this type of crash. Not only do you have to pay for the influx of medical bills that you are getting now because of the crash, but you also have to think about what other financial damages you have. For example, if you are having to miss work, we are able to seek out recompense for that. We will work closely with you to determine what types of damages you have suffered so we can count those in the filing.",

How are you doing with your New Year’s resolutions?\nThe Today Show on NBC recently featured some helpful tips on not only setting but also keeping your New Year’s resolutions far beyond January. Most people tend to quit after the first month of the year. Let that not be us!\n1) Be Honest with yourself – know what you need to change and admit it.\n2) Write down your goals – putting specific goals to paper is required for reaching them.\n3) Start a journal to track your progress, including why you may not have stuck to your goals in the past.\n4) Establish positive feedback. Set up a dangling carrot; in other words, a prize or reward for accomplishments.\n5) Be present in the moment. Appreciate today’s good moments.\n6) Establish stress reduction. This could be Yoga, meditation, quiet time, or whatever helps you cut down on the stress levels in your life.\n7) Gratitude makes you happy, so acknowledge all of the blessings in your life.\nKeeping your New Year’s resolutions is not easy, but these seven steps should be very helpful to anyone looking to make life improvements in 2013.",

    "text": "In a closely-watched trial, the former CFO of Aveo Pharmaceuticals has been found liable for federal securities fraud. On 20 November 2018, a jury in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts found that David Johnston failed to adequately disclose the company's interactions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over a kidney-cancer drug, called tivozanib. Aveo began clinical trials of tivozanib in 2010 and met with the FDA in May 2012 to discuss those trial results ahead of seeking FDA approval of the drug. In those meetings, the FDA expressed concerns about survival rates of patients on tivozanib and recommended that Aveo undertake a second clinical trial of the drug, but in subsequent public disclosures the company did not disclose that another trial could be necessary.\nIn 2016, the SEC brought a civil action against Aveo and certain of its executives. Aveo and the other executives settled the matter, leaving Johnston as the only defendant to go to trial. At his trial, Johnston argued that as the CFO, he relied upon the company's internal processes and advisors in deciding what to disclose about the FDA interactions. The advisors included in-house and external lawyers who allegedly approved the omission of the FDA's recommendation for a second trial. These communications with the company's attorneys were privileged, however, and the privilege was held by the company. As a result, the jury did not hear any testimony concerning the advice the attorneys provided, and the SEC questioned whether Johnston had provided the attorneys with sufficient information about the FDA interactions. In the end, Johnston was found liable after only four hours of jury deliberation.\nThe Aveo/Johnston case illustrates (a) the aggressiveness of the SEC in bringing disclosure actions, including against corporate executives who do not have any particular expertise in the subject matter being disclosed, and (b) the importance of well-documented corporate disclosure procedures.",

    "text": "and a network of researchers and experts working in this ﬁeld to be developed. The ﬁrst workshop in the series examined Asian experiences of quotas, and was held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in September 2002. The second workshop, on Latin American experiences of quotas, was held in Lima, Peru, in February 2003. The meeting on quotas in Africa, held in South Africa in November 2003, is the third in the series, and is to be followed by workshops in Europe and the Arab World in 2004. IDEA works in partnership with international, regional and local organizations. This workshop was organized in partnership with EISA and SADC PF. These partners, and others, are particularly important in light of the Southern African Development Community Declaration on Gender, obliging member states to achieve 30 percent representation of women by 2005. The countries represented in this meeting, however, were not only members of SADC. Experts also came from Central, East, North and West Africa, reﬂecting the diversity of the continent. Africa is an interesting region in regard to analyzing the successes and failures associated with quota implementation. The legislated quota system is employed in eight countries – Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Morocco, Namibia at the local level, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda (and previously in Egypt). Informal political party quotas exist in a further twelve nations. In a number of countries debates are taking place about the implementation of quotas, with women’s organizations at the local and regional levels actively lobbying for them. There are also important examples of quotas existing in decision-making bodies other than national parliaments, including the African Union (AU) and the SADC PF, as well as quotas that seek to include women in peace processes and negotiations, as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). While it is possibly too early to talk about a tradition of quota implementation on the continent, there are clear cases where quotas have been instrumental in ensuring women access to decision-making bodies.",

    "text": "If you have any number of skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema or rosacea, then you’ve probably learned about your skin’s barrier (if you haven’t yet, head over to my post about it here).\nTo quickly recap, our skin is made up of lipids, cells and protein rivets that create a wall-like, but still-permeable structure. This structure, or barrier, protects you and me from all kinds of internal and external threats.\nOn the one hand, our skin keeps the water content of our bodies safely where it belongs – in our bodies – with a high concentration of lipids, which essentially waterproof our skin.\nOn the other, it shields us from dangerous particles and microbes, including UV rays. It basically keeps the bad stuff out and the good stuff in – a veritable miracle of evolution that keeps us alive and healthy.\nSupporting your skin’s barrier by engaging in informed, healthy self-care activities like using skincare products with low pH levels is vital. Why?\nBecause, when your skin’s barrier isn’t supported properly due to internal issues like an autoimmune disease, outside pollutants like infectious bacteria or – in many cases – a combination of both, you can develop skin conditions like those mentioned above.\nA lack of support eventually weakens your skin’s barrier and it’s enzymatic functioning, so it’s less able to fight critical threats like infection and inflammation. Enter psoriasis, eczema and a host of other skin diseases. This motley crew of varied skin issues all happen to stem from the same root problem: weak skin barriers.\nSafe to say, the relationship your skin’s barrier has with whatever skin condition you’re dealing with is one that you want to pay attention to. The more you support your barrier, the faster you can heal an inflammatory skin disorder.\nNurture your skin and regularly build up that barrier with these tips, and see how amazingly your skin disorder responds. It’ll be a change for the better.",

Now over 30 years later, it’s clear that quattro® has changed the way we view driving.\nQuattro® started out as a way to revitalize the Audi brand. Audi needed something that would change the game, and establish them as a true competitor. Quattro® was their solution. After a few years of development, the quattro® system found itself at home on dirt and paved racetracks alike. In fact, when the Audi Quattro arrived at the World Rally Championship, it changed the rally world forever. Simply put, permanent all wheel drive cars didn’t exist before Audi put them in production.\nToday, you can still get behind the wheel of an Audi with quattro®. And in 2018, one size does not fit all. Audi has tailored the quattro® system to fit the vehicle it’s on. Because Audi understands, you don’t expect the same performance from an SUV as you do a super-car. But really, the only way for us to explain quattro®, is to let you get behind the wheel of an Audi and feel it for yourself.",

The Dee Why community cafe is open on Wednesday nights and the Balgowlah community cafe is open on Saturday nights. We estimate that we serve over 300 meals each month using a 100% volunteer workforce.\nThe cafes provide a nutritious meal (eg chicken curry and rice, fresh vegetables and dessert) and a supportive, caring atmosphere. Some of Street Mission's clients have been attending for many years. Additionally, warm clothing and bedding is distributed as well as referrals to support agencies.\nMany of Street Mission's clients have medical issues and life is tough for them. Our clients include adults and their children.",

    "text": "As I alluded to previously, immigration reform seems to me like an issue where radical tactics, if people could be organized to engage in them, would have high prospects for success. Among other things, Jose Antonio Vargas’ story today makes that clear on a number of levels.\nOne is that people were willing to help him in a civilly disobedient way, starting with the woman at the DMV who whispered to him that his papers were fake rather than reporting him. Another is that whatever ultimately happens to Vargas, INS agents haven’t rushed to his house to deport him ASAP. He’s not currently sitting in a detention cell being questioned about what knowledge editors at the Washington Post and Huffington Post had of his immigration status. When Vargas pitched the story to the Post, they apparently rejected it, but they didn’t turn around and immediately drop a dime on the guy.\nWhich is all just to say that the treatment of undocumented workers in this country is one of those things where we’re only kinda sorta willing to enforce the law. Faced with a known quantity — a friend, a colleague — nobody really wants to see a good person deported. Nobody really wants to make powerful people pay the price for complying with the law. And everyone knows we wouldn’t really even have the logistical capacity to deport every unauthorized migrant in the United States if they all turned themselves in tomorrow. The undocumented and their friends and family and allies have, in other words, the potential to take the broken immigration and really smash it the point where it doesn’t work at all. What the practical output of a crisis like that would be is difficult to say. But the point is that Washington basically doesn’t want this on the agenda. Politicians want to talk about deficit reduction and posture about jobs. But undocumented people could in principle force their way onto the agenda if there was enough will and organization. And I think the experience of the filibuster-happy 111th Congress makes it pretty clear that if we are going to see dramatic legislative change on this front it’s going to take something like that.",

The popular singer, performer, and VMA Artist of the Year will be starring in a new version of the classic tale with Kay Cannon directing. A longtime producer and writer, you might know Cannon’s work from the 2018 adult-comedy “Blockers” with Leslie Mann, John Cena, and Ike Barinholtz. “Blockers” was the feature debut for Cannon as a director, and this new Cinderella project will be Cabello’s debut as an actor. THR reported that Sony is fast-tracking the project, which means it could be ready for late 2020.\nSony Pictures is handling the adaptation, which does not have a release date or supporting cast at this time. James Corden, of “The Late Late Show with James Corden,” is producing the film and is one of the driving forces behind the project. Always a fan of musicals and pop-stars, we are excited to see what Corden and Cabello come up with together.\nThe Cinderella role has been a popular choice with young actors over the years. Cabello joins Drew Barrymore, Hilary Duff, and Lily James, all three played a version of the poor stepdaughter turned princess.\nA Cinderella Story” with Drew Barrymore made $98M in 1998, working from an estimated budget of $26M.\nSony Pictures hasn’t announced the casting at this time, but more information will be released as the film moves into production.\nThis new adaptation is expected to be a modern re-imagining, but Cabello is expected to play a down on her luck stepdaughter living with a hellish stepmother. Since Cabello is taking the lead role, it’s safe to say that there might be some singing.",

The event was hosted by the Club’s Director of Professional Sports Albert Soler and UNICEF’s Southern California regional director Amber Hill.\nAndres Iniesta was asked whether the team could win the treble again this season and replied: “it’s our obligation to try to, to fight to win every competition we are in”. On a personal note, one child wondered what was need to become like Iniesta, to which the Spanish international replied: “the important thing is to be yourself and always try and improve as a professional and as a person”.\nBoth UNICEF and FC Barcelona consider sport to be a key element in improving the lives of children across the world, particularly the most vulnerable and believe that playing is both a child’s right and an important tool in children’s physical, emotional, social and cognitive development.\nAlbert Soler commented: “today is a special day, because any event we hold with our principal partner UNICEF is a great pleasure. We would like to again take the opportunity to show our support for our sister organisation, whose work we identify with and who we are determined to continue working with with the same intensity. Sport, and football in particular, is a great tool to help transmit values to the world’s children”.\nIn response, Amber Hill explained that the key points in the alliance between UNCEF and FC Barcelona were based on: “a world in which all children receive a quality education and in which sport and games are fully integrated into school life\", before making an appeal to: “parents, teachers and the community in general to help us spread this vision and create a better world for all our children”.",

Yes, Taman Kunci is an abbreviation of Kupu-kupu and Kelinci (butterflies and rabbits). This park is part of a thematic park program promoted by the Tangerang City administration.\nOf the many parks in the Tangerang, Taman Kunci is one of the interesting educational tourist destinations. This park is located on Jalan Thamrin, Cikokol, Tangerang and opposite to Taman Potret. This 8000 m2 park offers a beautiful atmosphere with shady trees and several seats for visitors who want to relax. Taman Kunci makes the atmosphere in the heart of Tangerang a little greener.\nAs the name implies, this park is also a place for inspection and supervision of butterflies and rabbits. You can see through the park administrators effort who make a barrier for visitors who want to see the animals, so visitors can’t interact directly. Visitors can only look from outside the enclosure, to avoid unwanted things. At the beginning of the Taman Kunci opening, visitors are allowed to play with rabbits that are released around the park on purpose. Although it seems more natural, but the safety and health of rabbits is less guaranteed.\nPark rangers always check rabbits health regularly every two weeks. So, if there are sick rabbits, they will immediately be separated and quarantined until they are healthy again. At Taman Kunci, rabbits are also fed regularly, use rabbit pellets, carrots, kale, grass, and other vegetables.\nAside rabbits, there is also butterflies that are left to live freely in a unique dome-shaped building that stands in the middle of the park. Butterflies with beautiful colors immediately welcoming you as soon as they enter this dome.\nTaman Kunci can be an alternative destination that is not only cheap, but also educating.

    "text": "While most people have a vague idea as to how drug testing works, most don’t really consider alcohol testing as being something that will impact them in any foreseeable way. After all, it’s much rarer of a test and is actually more complicated than basic drug screenings. For most testing purposes, the EtG alcohol urine test is what is primarily used.\nThese tests look for the compound Ethyl Glucuronide, shortened to EtG in most instances. This compound is a metabolite of alcohol and is present in the body after one consumes a drink. However, this alcohol urine test is only accurate for roughly the previous 80 hours. The EtG is gone from the system of most drinkers after this period of time.\nFor those who need a more detailed analysis than the EtG alcohol urine test, there is an EtG hair screening test that can be used. It provides the opportunity to determine whether or not a person has used alcohol within the last 90 days, and is more accurate than the basic urine analysis – however, it’s more expensive as a result of this.\nIt’s also important to understand that the EtG alcohol test isn’t primarily used for a pre-employment screening. Instead, it’s mainly used in situations where courts order alcohol testing because an individual is restricted from drinking. Probation orders and DUI programs are two perfect examples of this, and in some instances alcohol testing may be used as part of a custody or divorce case where alcohol abuse has played a major role in the breakdown of the marriage or the safety of the children.\nIn short, these types of alcohol testing options aren’t really used for employment screening.

    "text": "What is my goal when I play hockey? To win? To win playoff championships? To be the best goalie? Everyone has their standards they set and mine has always been championship or bust. I have been very fortunate to be on many championship teams. Some have been the best in the league after the season is over and have cruised through the playoffs. Others have been #4 seeds that have barely made it in, and yet won it all. Then I have had some #1 seeds that have dominated through the regular season, and then struggled in playoffs and got ousted.\nIn the end, its all about that trophy I lift up at the end of the day on Saturday. Now, why is that? A lot of it has to do with how others look at me. I always feel the pressure of the people I play with and against to look at me favorably. I feel like a failure if I don’t win it all. If I don’t win my final game of the playoffs, its a bad season to me.\nThose are very lofty expectations. I have been fortunate to be a playoff champion for the better part a year and a half. Six consecutive seasons I have been a champion on one or more teams. A total of 18 trophies later, and I am still hungry for another one.\nAt the same time though, all good things must come to an end. Will that streak end this season? I would like to think no, but who knows how it will all turn out. When my season does and, and I don’t hold a trophy in my hands, I should not be discouraged. You can’t be a champion every season. New players should get the opportunity to taste victory. New teams should get the chance to be a winner.\nIn the end, I have achieved more than I can possibly imagine.\nThe reason for this post is to have me realize that this run I have been on for the longest time is going to end soon. When it does, I know I will be devestated. In return, I will probably retreat deep within myself and not want to go out with my friends or the other players. Mainly because of how others will view me. That isn’t the right course of action.",

There are different types of adventure tourism, ranging from high-risk activities such as climbing or caving (hard adventure) to low-risk activities like ecotourism and volunteer tourism (soft adventure).\nCommunity-based tourism is “a form of ecotourism that emphasizes the development of local communities and allows for local residents to have substantial control over, and involvement in, its development and management, and a major proportion of the benefits remain within the community. Community-based ecotourism should foster sustainable use and collective responsibility, but it also embraces individual initiatives within the community” (Bortner, 2013).\nEcotourism is “responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education” (TIES, 2015).\nPro-poor tourism (PPT) is “tourism that results in increased net benefits for poor people. PPT is not a specific product or niche sector but an approach to tourism development and management. It enhances the linkages between tourism businesses and poor people, so that tourism’s contribution to poverty reduction is increased and poor people are able to participate more effectively in product development” (Pro-Poor Tourism Partnership, 2004).\nSustainable Tourism is “tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment, and host communities” (UNEP & UNWTO, 2005).\nVoluntourism is the intersection of international volunteering and tourism (Clemmons, 2012). “Volunteer tourism is a form of travel which involves volunteering for a worthy, often charitable cause“ (Tomazos, 2010).",

My understanding is that a new Walmart Super-store was built very near the store where Jodi Arias bought the gas can. The old, smaller store then became entirely a Walmart auto service center. Correct me if I’m wrong.\nThe new store took the number of the old store and the old store got a NEW store number. So, even though records are automated and stored in data bases, it’s true that you only find what you’re looking for, and if you didn’t look in all the correct places, you will not find what you are looking for.\nI am told that Amanda Webb DID find the record of the SALE. There was a record of a RETURN a week later and I do suppose that gas cans are probably returned very rarely. This COULD mean the return was inputted wrong or not at all, and a week later they fixed the mistake.\nRob, Yes, that return a week late just might have something to do with it. I agree it is probably not very common for a gas can to be returned. Perhaps it was put to one side for some reason and entered later.",

The evening featured an all acoustic performance with Phoenix Mendoza on lead guitar, Jamey Garner on Harmonica, guitar and some small percussion elements and Kevin Campos on rhythm guitar. The three members shared lead vocals with some incredible harmonies reminiscent of the Eagles and their other musical influences.\nHigh South played 2 hour+ sets, each containing original songs and great covers of classics. Among the covers were Aime by Pure Prairie League, Dancing in the Moonlight by Van Morrison, America’s Ventura Highway and Take it Easy by the Eagles.\nThe band of singer-songwriters shared how their trip to Joshua Tree had influenced their music, including the song Joshua Tree. At one point the band unplugged and went out into the audience for an entire song, interacting with the crowd in this intimate sized venue. Campos commented on how the venue had allowed them to be closer to the audience and interact more than usual, something that all three of the band members seemed to enjoy.\nGarners harmonica playing was pretty incredible, even simulating the whistle of a train in a song inspired by trains passing through town during summer nights of his youth.

I wanted charity cards but didn't want ones that look too 'corporate' which seems to be the way a lot of them are structured. I found some great ones at BioMe but they were $17 for a pack of 10 (but recycled and 10% went to Doctors without borders). I was going to buy them, but then worked out how many SJ and I would need to send...100. So Christmas cards, plus stamps would cost me $225. Seemed slightly extreme.\nThankfully, I stumbled across the cards pictured on the RSPCA Victoria shop. I bought two sets, white ones and coloured animal ones. Much cheaper at $6 a pack of 10...however, as it is so close to Christmas they are now only $3 a pack! That's right, you can get them for 30c each, even cheaper than the stamp you'll need to send them! Plus since they are being sold by the RSPCA, you can be assured that all the profits will be going directly to them.\nHave I mentioned how much I love mail??\nCute! Every year I buy Christmas cards, but never get around to sending them.",

    "text": "Facebook has already made some big changes to their ad targeting platform following a complaint from Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson earlier this month. The complaint alleges that Facebook’s ad targeting options violate fair housing laws by allowing advertisers to discriminate based on users’ interests and family status. For example, the platform was allowing advertisers to block ads from Facebook users that have listed “child care” or “parenting” among their interests to exclude those with children. The complaint also alleges that advertisers had the option to not show ads to users in designated zip codes.\nIn response to the complaint, Facebook removed over 5,000 ad targeting options from their advertising platform to “prevent misuse,” according to a company blog post. Facebook is also expanding their advertiser education program with a new certification that all advertisers will need to complete to continue advertising on the platform.\nThe case is a good reminder that even in the 50th anniversary year of the Fair Housing Act, just because an advertising option is available to you doesn’t mean it’s legal. REALTORS® everywhere should know the law and fight for the right of all Americans to have access to homeownership and equal housing.",

With the day behind you and the promise of a good night’s sleep ahead, you can unwind, reflect, and take the time to center yourself before going to bed. Here’s how you can incorporate mindfulness into your nighttime routine.\nResearch has shown that the blue light from computers, smartphones, and other electronic devices can make it harder to fall asleep at night. Electronics are also highly distracting – it’s hard to live in the moment when you’ve got a dozen tabs open in your browser. Turn off your gadgets for at least one hour before you go to bed.\nIf you keep a mindfulness journal, evenings are a perfect time to write in it, since the events of the day are still fresh in your mind. Jot down some observations about what you experienced and accomplished, and make a note of your thoughts and feelings. If you’re working on improving your productivity, make a note of what you want to accomplish the next day.\nBefore you turn off the lights, take the time to lay out the next day’s clothes and program your coffee maker. Setting things up for your future self will help you feel less stressed about the upcoming day, and you’ll have a more productive morning if you prepare ahead of time.\nIncorporating mindfulness into your evening routine won’t just help you fall asleep more easily. It will also help you maintain a brighter outlook and get more done around the clock. Incorporate these tips into your nighttime routine, and you’ll reap the benefits all day long.",

Norman was in charge of car park design in the only way he knows…’it will fit in there!’ Once all guests had arrived and were ready to sit down for service, we scarpered.

Consider this one person’s opinion, for what it’s worth.\nThis is not “The Biggest Loser”.\nIf this is a race, it is a marathon.\nIt is not how fast you lose, but how long you keep at it.\nWhether you believe it or not, the program works when you follow it.\nYou are not going to always see an immediate link between your efforts and your results, but over time you will.\nBe honest with yourself about what effort you are putting into the program. If you are lying to yourself, you are wasting your time.\nAccurate, honest tracking of what you eat is critical as you start. In fact, it’s critical throughout.\nThis is like horseshoes and hand grenades. If you consistently get close, you’ll win over time.\nAssigned too Many PointsPlus per Day?\nIf you still think you have too many points, go through the exercise of figuring out how many PointsPlus a “normal” pre-WW day would have. Short version; you don’t get too many points.\nFor the official WW advice on eating your points, read tinyurl.com/WWonPoints.\nCheck goadies.org for acronyms and more.\nAsk questions: ask for help when you struggle, and then do something with the feedback you get.\nAnd yes, there are ladies posting on the Guys message boards just like there are guys posting on the Meeting Members or Maintenance message board.

    "text": "Peter had walked a few steps on water, towards Jesus, before he began to sink. He started off courageous, he started off believing, he started off with a goal in mind. But after a while, he began to sink; he saw the wind and began to sink. Does this mean the wind wasn't blowing before he started walking on water?\nNo! In fact, if you go back to read from verse 22, you'd see that the wind had already been blowing. What could possibly cause a man who started off strong to sink?\nAs Christians, why is our faith shaken at the first sight of \"wind\"? The world isn't an all jolly place; it is filled with many troubles. Jesus himself told us what to expect in John 16:33. There will be troubles, there will be trials, there will be moments when we are pushed to the wall. The Bible has never sugar coated the struggles we will face as believers but we have been reassured countless times of the victory we already have in Christ. Is this enough to keep us prepared?\nThe moment we take our eyes off Jesus, we become conscious of our nakedness, we become aware of the raging storms around us, we become vulnerable to fear. And then we begin to sink- Peter didn't begin to sink until he paid attention to the wind. Our troubles may seem big but we need to keep our eyes on something bigger, something that cannot be moved; an anchor that cannot be broken- We need to keep our eyes on God.\nOur worries are nothing compared to the hope we have in Christ. Our brokenness is temporary and the world is temporary. There's an ultimate prize, a beautiful end and an everlasting victory.\n\"When you feel like you're at the end of your ROPE, you're not at the end of your HOPE\"\nAction words: Challenge yourself this week to fix your eyes on Christ no matter what the weather brings.",

There is a section on the tax return where you fill in your donations amount which aren't subject to tax and you would include this there. If you are audited however you may need to prove that you are not performing the same work for the same community on a recurring basis. It is also very important that you are not paid by anyone you are performing tasks for and that the they are not connected to the person who you are doing the charitable work for. In a sense you are being given money to do good things!",

People could go to Kenya and start new lives, be out and proud, and eventually the past would catch up to them, and then they would have to murder someone.\nHeat of the Sun is a fun and interesting BBC crime drama. Kenya is a beautiful setting, and seeing a glimpse of life there during the 1930s was so interesting.\nI found Supt. Albert Tyburn, played by Trevor Eve, to be charming and intelligent.

    "text": "Aside from the traditional usage, the term empire can be used in an extended sense to denote a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), or a political organisation of either national-, regional- or city scale, controlled either by a person (a political boss) or a group authority (political bosses).\nAn imperial political structure is established and maintained in two ways: (i) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force (direct, physical action to compel the emperor's goals), and (ii) as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power (the perception that the emperor can physically enforce his desired goals). The former provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion. Territorial empires (e.g. the Mongol Empire, the Median Empire) tended to be contiguous areas. The term on occasion has been applied to maritime empires or thalassocracies, (e.g. the Athenian and British Empires) with looser structures and more scattered territories.",

Told in alternating viewpoints by four of his classmates (but crucially, not from the shooter's viewpoint), the story briskly covers forty or so minutes of terror and mayhem. Each of the narrators have ample opportunity to reflect on what they know about the shooter and his victims.\nDespite the dramatic potential of the story, there isn't much of a tale to tell. People ruminate and tremble with fear, while others die. And with a large cast of characters, it was hard to get overly attached so the casualties are mostly just a body count.I never felt invested in anyone, although I remained curious about who would live and who would die.\nI am stuck on the question of what it is all for?

    "text": "I've been dancing since I was 5 years old. I remember when my Mom took me to Ballet Class in Brooklyn, NY, I was so excited, I could barely contain myself. After I moved to Puerto Rico at the age of 9, I never went back to ballet, not because I didn't want to, but there was always some sort of obstacle that got in the way. I started getting involved with sports instead and forgot all about dancing until I got to High School, where I became Co-captain of the Cheer Squad and started the dance team. I kept choreographing in college and performing here and there, but never anything serious. About 4 years ago, I got the itch again and I formed the dance team in Puerto Rico for the Young Women's Division for the Soka Gakkai Intl., Buddhist Organization. We performed in every chance we had and it felt wonderful!\nFlash forward to today, I'm 31 years old and I haven't stopped moving. I formed the dance team for the SGI YWD in San Antonio, TX, my new home. I've realized that dancing doesn't only make me happy, but it's a vehicle for joy for others as well. I get other young women to dance and feel good about themselves and we make our audience happy. We're not professional dancers, any of us, but the energy, the fun we have and the desire to make people get up from their seats and move, has given me more joy than I could ever imagine. My mission is to create a world of peace through the power of movement. I will never stop dancing!\n\"Live with a dancing spirit. The stars in the heavens are dancing through space, the Earth never ceases to spin. All life is dancing: the trees with the wind, the waves on the sea, the birds, the fish, all are performing their own dance of life. Every living thing is dancing, and you must keep dancing too, for the rest of your life!\"",

For those of you who are wondering what happened to me during this summer... Life happened to me. First off one of my friends had to get married, so I was not technically a bridesmaid, but I was kind of forced into helping out? I guess you would say... Anyway, so long story short, there were a lot of issues, and I got a job. So that basically summed up why I was away from my blog for so long. Today, I'm going to be reviewing a new brand called Ark Beauty. Now for those of you who are like, what's Ark Beauty? Ark Beauty is a skincare company that's made in Britain, and seriously you guys, I'm in love with their masque.\nFor those of you who are curious as to what this smells like, I would have to say that it just smells natural. And when I first applied this masque on my face, I was like omg, this feels like vaseline, but surprisingly enough even though it felt like vaseline on my face, when it washed away, there was no sticky feeling.\nThis moisturizer has the same type of smell. It just smells natural. When I first got in this moisturizer, I was like how do I use this thing? And seriously guys, I thought I was suppose to pull the rubber thing on the top off, but no, all you do is put your hand on top of this container, and push down, and the moisturizer just dispenses out.\nFor those of you who are wondering where you can purchase Ark Beauty here is a link! I would have to give the products 5 stars, because not only does it make my skin feel amazing, I can see an improvement on how my skin is now compared to before. Honestly, my dark circles are almost gone, and my skin feels tighter! What would you guys like to try from Ark Beauty?",

Nature has much to teach us although, sadly, Homo Sapiens have little to learn when it comes to killing. Rebel Voice finds it intriguing to see how the micro world does it, though, and the battle between Dune Ant and Spoor Spider is one to watch.",

The current King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf is its High Protector. The core of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology was the Laboratorium Mechanicum for research and teaching in mechanics, founded in Stockholm in 1697 by Christopher Polhem after his extensive trips, studies and research abroad. This core was later called the Mechanical School prior to its 1827 transformation into The Technological Institute, Sweden's first institute of technology (polytechnic) by decision of the King Charles XIV John of Sweden, also Marshal of France, modeled after École Polytechniquewhich was founded by Napoleon Bonaparte in Paris, France in 1794. The Technological Institute changed its name to the present Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH Royal Institute of Technology) in 1877 by decree of King Oscar II. The Laboratorium Mechanicum was itself in 1925 handed over from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology to the Swedish Museum of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. KTH Royal Institute of Technology is the highest ranked university of technology in northern mainland Europe (Sweden, Scandinavia, Baltics, Poland and Northern Germany), and Germany, with the only exception in these areas being the Technical University of Munich, Germany.",

Home to the rich and famous, Cheshire is known for more than cheese and grinning cats. This county has turned out many a famed actor, musician and author and is home to some of the most affluent individuals in the United Kingdom. It comes as no surprise then to find window shutters at every turn.\nElegant and effortlessly stylish, window shutters compliment the Victorian and Georgian properties commonly found in Cheshire. But even younger generations of houses benefit from the addition of shutters. Faceless facades are brought to life with classic exterior window shutters and blank internal walls are turned into style statements with the addition of these smart, practical and elegant folding panels.\nWindow shutters for people living in Cheshire serve the same purpose they have done for years: as a sophisticated yet practical window treatment that blocks out light, keeps in the heat and delivers superior control over the light of the room.\nPrivacy and security are additional benefits derived from installing window shutters in your home. Cheshire residents are well aware of these added extras. Not only do their homes look great, prying eyes and nosy neighbours are kept at bay by the louvres of the shutters lying horizontally across the windows.\nThe joy for Cheshire home owners is also in the control and myriad of options that window shutters provide. With just the twist of a tilt rod, the louvres are angled up or down, bouncing more light into a room or angling it away, out of the home for increased darkness.\nCombined with the heat-saving properties of this timeless window treatment, Cheshire home owners are saving up to 8% more heat and at least £1000 over 8 years. Window shutters are the only window treatment to do this. To find out more and install window shutters in your Cheshire home, contact Shutter Boutique today. Our master craftsmen are on hand to take your call.",

According to Shakti Vahini NGO, six minor girls were rescued – two from the houses of their employers and four from the premises of the LG placement agency.\nThe girls were on Thursday produced before the CWC which ordered that cases be registered under the Juvenile Justice Act against the employers and traffickers. In line with a CWC order, a team of crime branch and representatives of two NGOs was formed and raids were conducted on Wednesday. While four girls – 13, 17 and 11 years of age – were rescued from the premises of the agency, two sisters aged 18 and 15 years were rescued from the house of their employers where they were working since the last few months after being placed by the agency, the NGO claimed in a statement. Three of the girls had allegedly not been paid by their employers and one was sent back to the agency on allegation of theft. Most of the girls were trafficked from villages in West Bengal and the agency is allegedly run by two persons named Laxman and Rahu.\nThe CWC directed the crime branch to produce the rescued kids before it and also asked it to produce a girl found at one of the raided houses, who prima facie did not appear to beminor. The CWC also directed NGO Shakti Vahini to contact the anti human trafficking unit of West Bengal to expedite the repatriation of the girls to their families. It also said a statement of all girls should be recorded before the SDM under the Bonded Labour Act, and all six should be provided shelter and care.",

The $15 fee doesn't apply to some United loyalty-plan clients.\nSuch fees are part of a broad effort by airlines to charge passengers for services once included in the price of a ticket. Some charge for in-flight meals, drinks and snacks.\nUnited said fees for checking the first and second bags would generate about $275 million a year.\nAlso yesterday, US Airways Group Inc. announced sweeping cuts in service and hikes in fees to cover sky-high fuel costs. The carrier based in Tempe, Ariz., said it will cut domestic flights, shrink its fleet, slash 1,700 jobs, charge passengers $15 to check a first bag for tickets booked or after July 9, and add a $2 fee for non-alcoholic inflight drinks.",

Microwave for a few seconds to dissolve the sugar and salt. Transfer your rice to a large bowl and cover in the vinegar mixture. Stir until fully combined and your rice looks glossy.\nPrepare your filling ingredients and set aside.\nPlace one nori sheet glossy side down on a bamboo mat and press a handful of rice onto the lower ⅔ of the sheet. At the bottom of the rice, place your filling ingredients. Try not to overfill it or it will be difficult to roll and you may break the nori sheet.\nUse your bamboo sheet to gently tuck and roll the nori sheet with the filling inside. Once it is rolled, use the bamboo sheet to gently press your vegan sushi rolls together so it sticks better.\nUsing a sharp knife, cut your sushi into rolls. Wipe your knife clean with a damp cloth after every cut to ensure your cuts are smooth.\nServe with soy sauce, wasabi, or dipping sauce of your choice.\nI’ve never tried to make my own sushi but now I have to give it a try!",

The Flexi-Wing strap attachment, an advanced design, evenly disperses the support throughout the mask. Integral to this strap is a head harness, which ensures correct positioning as well as increasing wearer comfort and acceptance. The 1-Strap makes correct fitting almost foolproof.\nBeing exceptionally easy to put on it increases the likelihood of it being worn - important where workers need their mask intermittently throughout the day. The single strap and easy-to-grasp harness make it of particular benefit to those who use gloves or have difficulty with twin strap masks.\nThis unique and ergonomically designed respirator incorporates ActivForm® - a self-adjusting fitting system complete with a flexible foam nose seal. This combination significantly reduces inward leakage by automatically adjusting to different face shapes, unlike other disposable respirators, which rely on the user utilising the press-to-fit technique. The 1-Strap ensures a quick, secure fit upon contact. What’s more, in conjunction with the DuraMesh® shell, its shape and fit are retained throughout the working day. It does not require any adjustment by the user.\nSpecially designed to make use quicker and easier the 1-Strap comes in a choice of protection levels (FFP1 or FFP2) and is available with or without the Moldex patented Ventex®-Valve.",

Some of the signs read: Catholic, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Other Christian, Muslim.\nTowards the end of the 20th century the fashion became the lawn cemetery. However I noticed that these were still divided into groupings by religion. More than half of Australians prefer cremation now, and this number is growing, but the lawn cemetery is still the preferred method for a lot of people, though not necessarily divided into religious groupings any more.\nThen I got to thinking. It seems that our idea of God, our conception of heaven and earth has dictated how we bury our dead. It was clear in the early days that it was believed that our wealth needed to be displayed so that a manlike god could decide where we fitted into a mortal-like heaven. He also needed to know whether we believed in Him or not, if we were in high church, the chosen church, or none.\nPatrick looked with awe at the chocolate iced donut. Was it all just for him? His immediate response was to break it in two pieces – half for Lani, his much-adored older sister, and half for him. He was quickly reassured that Elena had already eaten her donut while he was having an afternoon nap and that it was all for him. He quickly complied by gobbling it down with sheer delight.",

    "text": "Today I am here to share with you the washi tape initial wall art that I made as part of the collage wall that I put together when I helped my dad redecorate his family room. I love the way this giant initial turned out! My dad was a bit skeptical about the bicycle washi tape, but I think a little whimsy in life is a good thing, don’t you?\nLet’s talk about how I created this fun washi tape wall art. I started with a GIANT wooden letter, which I believe I found at Hobby Lobby (use a coupon!). I painted the top of the letter white, so that the thinner washi would have a white background, and the edges of the letter black, so that it would match the frames on the wall. Here is what happened next . . .\nNext I just started going for it with the washi. I laid it out in strips across the letter and didn’t worry about trimming until the end. I also chose not to do an exact pattern, but mixed it up a bit. I did try to space the bicycles out fairly evenly, though, since they really stand out on the letter. One of the things that I love about washi is that you can always reposition it if you don’t like where you placed it initially, similar to masking tape.\nTo finish up, I trimmed the edges of the washi tape off and then I painted a thin layer of Mod Podge on top of the washi and just over the edges to seal everything firmly to the letter.\nAll done! What do you think? Now let’s take a look at the wall art in action, shall we?\nI am so excited about the way that my washi tape initial wall art turned out. It is such a fun addition to our family room gallery wall. Now go get busy and make your own!\nLove it, it looks great! Thanks for sharing this at the Dishing It & Digging It Link Party.\nI have a bunch of washing tape in my stash, and I forget to do anything with it. Your big “W” looks great! I love the patterns in your black & white washing tape. It looks great on your gallery wall.",

To alleviate the guilt, I made sure I did 1000$ worth of work.\nIt’s not about how much they pay, it’s about whether you feel you deserve the amount. It’s not the more money you get that makes you satisfied, it’s the higher you think you’re worth.\nWhen you’re doing well with your work, or happy with friends, it’s no problem spending more than usual to have a good break. But when you’re stuck with work, stressed with school, or just merely in a bad mood, you start to question if the penny spent is well justified.\nIt’s not about how much you spend, it’s about how the spending is justified, and most of the times, that depends on your mood and situation.\nRemember this, always: What can be solved by money, should be solved by money.\nI love to move house.\nWhen I pack my stuff, I get to decide which ones to throw away, and which ones to bring along with me.

It’s Kara from A Kailo Chic Life and I want to share how easy it is to have your kids make a their own summer memory box to hold sea shells from your summer beach trip, instant photos of family fun, and any thing else they deem important.\nBegin by letting your kids paint their wooden box however they like. This is a great summer activity to keep their hands busy for a bit.\nOnce the box has been painted, cut your photo to size and use the decoupage medium to paint the lid of the memory box. Then lay your photo on top of the decoupage medium coated lid and add a second layer of decoupage glue over the top of the photo to seal it into place.\nOnce the decoupage glue has dried, let the kids add stickers (such as the year or their name) to the box. Then it is time to fill the box with all their summer memories!\nThis is really a project that even the youngest crafter can make and they will love having their own special box for all their treasures. Now it’s just time to go take that walk at the local park so they can pick a few flowers, or take a trip to the splash pad for some fun water play photos. I can just see this becoming a yearly tradition. How fun would it be to look back through the past summers at all the fun that was had and trips that were taken?!\nI hope you enjoyed this tutorial for the DIY summer memories box. Feel free to check out my blog, A Kailo Chic Life, for even more fun crafts and DIY ideas!",

With sweet french toast serving as the sandwich bread and savory ham and cheese inside, it's the perfect cure for whatever ails you. If you're feeling adventurous, feel free to top this copycat sandwich recipe with powdered sugar or syrup. Change up your routine with this simply delicious dish.\nI'd love the recipe for Bennigan's potato soup!\nSorry, but I have to agree with Iakota7sioux..., but the sandwich was cut in halves, held together with toothpicks, then battered with an egg batter (no milk in it, I don't think - but it reminds me a beer-batter vs breaded). And, yes, after cooking cooling a tad, it was topped with a sifted powdered sugar, and served with raspberry jam. One of my fav's - but only occasionally (not for those on a diet)! I miss it so much!!\nThe monte cristo was the best thing on Bennigan's menu! Too bad they're mostly closed now, but I'm happy to see I can still enjoy this sandwich!\nI love bennigans Monte cristo sandwich, but if I'm not mistaken theirs has raspberry preserves on it, and I thought it was deep fried! am I wrong?",

Their only win of the season came in week three when they took on the Houston Texans. As sad as it may be, the Giants are nothing new to offensive struggles.\nBoston came into Game 2 fresh off a Game 1 win, and LA looked to even the series at one a piece.\nThe NFL has a reputation of being America’s ‘no fun’ league for multiple seasons. From penalties due to excessive celebration or customized footwear, the NFL is on its way to becoming the most hated league by its own players. Recently though, the NFL has become more lenient with uniform regulations and what players can and cannot wear on their feet.\nLate round players often emerge as huge stars; players like Antonio Brown, Richard Sherman, and last year’s standouts Kareem Hunt and Alvin Kamara, were all post-3rd round picks. Tom Brady, arguably the greatest QB of all-time, was picked in the sixth round. However this season, it’s top picks like Sam Darnold and Saquon Barkley that the fans are excited about, and the beginning of the season has been no disappointment.\nBeing an athlete is tough, but being a female athlete can be extremely challenging. Although men and women are equal in the sense of athleticism there tends to be a double standard in the media in the way female athletes are treated. Instead of focusing on their athletic abilities, magazines are often more focused on what the athlete is wearing than the game itself.",

Checking the tracking number and then the day comes. You drive up the driveway and see something by your door. Your heart starts pounding and as quickly as you can you park the car get out and try to keep from running. You get to the door and find It's something your daughter ordered. Now your mad at her for getting her package first. She gets mad at you for being mad at her and now no one is talking. Who knew ordering a violin could cause such problems.\nHahhaha Kevin, you are cracking me up.\nWell, i sicerely apologize for not being able to assist with your query, but i do sympathize.\ni ordered one too so Im curious to see myself. holiday weekend to take into account as well.\nWell they get their violin first i guess. Lol.\nWaiting patiently is hard though, so i feel your pain.\nIf you just bought it there is a slight chance that it will ship on Tuesday or Wednesday. We sold a lot of violins this past week and I'm not sure that we have them all in stock. I am relatively sure that we do though. In any case, to answer your question, as long as we have the items in stock they ship the next working day or in the worse case second day and arrive within 5 working days but usually much faster since we use FedEx for violin outfits. Exactly how long depends on how far you live from Florida. We send out tracking information soon after we ship the items. Michael, is out of town on Tuesday so I am not sure I'll get everything done on Tuesday.\nI'll do my best though. Need to test a lot of violins.",

    "text": "Despite his Italian roots, Giampaolo Amoruso (1961) has spent his entire life in Belgium. His passion for glass can be traced back to the glassworks in Boussu, where he received his initial training. He was so enthralled by glass that, when the factory closed, he decided to specialise in various glassworking techniques, developing into the internationally acclaimed glass artist is today.\nAlthough the works of art created by Amoruso are often brightly coloured, they can also be very subdued. They are always minutely finished. His blown glass sculptures portray a wide range of expressions, sometimes leaning towards the absurd, yet they always remain highly recognisable.\nWhen people meet, their attention is instantly drawn to the face. The head is where all communication takes place and the source from which our emotions - and our capacity for rational thinking - stem. In this respect, it is hardly surprising that heads are so often featured in works of art. This principle can also be applied to the work of Amoruso. In addition to his collection of heads, he also creates ‘puppets’, small and whimsical figurines that will bring a smile to the beholder. However, beneath the cheerful colours and shapes, a very different set of emotions can be discerned by those that have the courage to want to see them.",

    "text": "Deflation is defined as a decrease in the general price level.\nIt is a negative inflation rate.\nDeflation means the value of money will increase.\nDeflation is often associated with periods of negative or stagnant economic growth (Great Depression, Japanese economy in the 1990s, early 2000s). In fact, deflation is often used to express a declining economy.\nPeople delay spending; hoping prices will be lower next year; this causes further falls in aggregate demand and rate of economic growth.\nWorkers resist nominal wage cuts. Therefore, real wages rise causing real wage unemployment.\nReal interest rates become too high. Even interest rates of 0% cannot induce people to spend creating a liquidity trap.\nDeflation increases the burden of debt and reduces the disposable income of indebted people.\nDeflation can become entrenched in the economy – causing sluggish rates of economic growth.\nHowever, if deflation is caused by rising productivity, improved technology and lower costs, the deflation may not be harmful but beneficial.\nThis shows how a shift in SRAS to the right causes lower price level.\nBetween 1920 and 1936, the UK had a prolonged period of deflation, with the inflation rate rarely rising above zero.",

We had already made a start before Christmas, I'm sure you can see Minnie peeking through the clutter.\nLots of changes were made, none of them major but I feel they made a huge difference.\n* We swapped the cot and changer round which opened up the room a bit more.\n* Curtains, bedding and light shade now completely Minnie.\n* I added a book corner, complete with my cuddly elephant that is a young 28 years old himself!!\n* The changer is now clutter free and in its place the very handy bunny night light and of course Minnie mouse to watch over Layla.\nWith the Minnie makeover complete, I was sad to see all of the Winnie the Pooh removed from the room, reminded me that my girls really are all growing up however it is nice to see that Layla now has a proper space of her own to not only sleep in but play in too.\nHow are your children's rooms decorated, do they have a particular theme??",

Dr. Westerberg is assisting with the creation of a mobile web app to help family members learn ways to support the Driving While Impaired (DWI) offender in their family. The goal is to decrease the offender’s drinking and risk of drinking and driving when an ignition interlock device has been mandated by the courts. The randomized control trial will take place in New Mexico.\nBefore pursuing clinical administration, Dr. Westerberg’s research investigated treatments for substance use disorders and some of the mechanisms underlying such disorders in clinical populations. His interests included substance use craving and mechanisms underlying relapse to alcohol use after quitting.\nIn addition to collaborating with Klein Buendel, Dr. Westerberg operates his own business that focuses on program evaluation and research for behavioral health programs that serve primarily less-advantaged populations. He also volunteers as part of a committee at a homeless treatment facility where he advises on the use of data to implement, improve, and assess clinical and medical programs.

    "text": "In using the .NET Runtime in WPF, we've noticed something odd with max extent. If a TPK is the first basemap loaded to the map, it can set the MapView's maximum extent, restricting pan/zoom to only the extent of the TPK. This is an issue because we allow them to specify any number of basemaps and freely switch between them. As one can guess, it is frustrating to switch to an imagery layer and not be able to pan to anywhere you'd like to.\nWe could get around this problem by always loading a world-wide basemap first. However, we want users to have a fully useable app when starting it while offline. Since the MapView breaks if it can't get to the first basemap added, this isn't a viable option.\nIs there a way to programmatically remove/prevent the pan/zoom limits?",

I am a carrot chaser; I love results! And I especially gravitate towards opportunities where our small actions can have tangible impact. As I shared in my last post, it blows my mind that that a $1 purchase can result in everything from school supplies to vaccines to meals (10 of them! for $1!). The 12 charity partners that will benefit from Red Nose Day include local organizations my kids have benefited from (Boys & Girls Clubs of America), US + international organizations I have supported through media or direct donation (charity:water, Feeding America, Gavi, The Global Fund, Oxfam America, Save the Children, United Way), and organizations that I can’t believe I already didn’t know about or are newer to me (Children’s Health Fund, LIFT, National Council of La Raza, National Urban League). So, so great.\nSo whether or not your local Walgreens has an expansive cosmetics emporium, please help out and purchase a red nose and watch the live show on May 21 (the lineup is CRAZY AMAZING!). And don’t forget to share your red nose photos using the hashtags #Walgreens #RedNose #promo for a chance to win a trip to New York City to attend the May 21 live event!\nAnd if you missed it last go around, this video offers a quick introduction to our media team and why we're passionate about Red Nose Day.

It will offer support in problems encountered by actors in this sector. For example, the law clinic can help solve problems associated with experimental projects and, on the other hand, it will actively approach such projects to ask about any needs to cut through the jungle of regulations.\nWhile the municipalities are key actors in terms of the built environment, regulation in this field is drafted by the central government. Those drafting the statutes are not always aware of the impacts on the municipalities’ information systems. If they have no understanding of the world of electronic data production, statutes that are incompatible with these systems may be created. System suppliers, on the other hand, need to be informed better about the schedules of legislative projects to be able to integrate timely modifications in their systems.

    "text": "The Northrop Grumman Campus of Excellence project in Melbourne, FL, is a several hundred-million-dollar project that includes fully renovating and significantly increasing existing buildings to a 173-acre campus consisting of 12 total buildings and four new ones. The four new buildings total 397,476 square feet and the project is creating almost 2,000 new jobs at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport.\nConstruction Engineering Group provided civil, mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineering services for the Satcom Direct project in Viera, FL. Civil engineering services consisted of designing and permitting a master-plan campus with multiple phases. The first phase comprised site amenities to accommodate a three-story, 39,645-square-foot office building, with a first-level lobby, shop, gym, storage, labs, stairs and covered parking. Parking included spaces, driveways, a loading/delivery area, sidewalks, additional utility infrastructure, landscaping, and storm-water treatment. In addition, construction administration services were provided throughout the project. Phase two will consist of enclosing the bottom level and converting the garage to office tenant space for a total building area of 68,610 square feet. The mechanical, electrica, and plumbing engineering services for the first phase included DX HVAC system and controls, plumbing connections, building electrical design, lighting plans, stand-by generator design, fire protection system and site lighting design with an exterior electrical plan for connections.\nThis project consisted of a multi-phase expansion of the existing Space Coast Credit Union Headquarters in the Suntree area of Brevard County, FL. The first two phases of this spectacular project consisted of the headquarters building expansion of 44,344 square feet in addition to the existing 80,268-square-foot structure with a 226,248-square-foot, four-story parking garage built on the northwest corner of the site, all infrastructure improvements such as off-site utilities, and the master-planned storm-water treatment system. In addition to the permitting and design of the complete campus, CEG provided construction oversight for the phases of the project that have been constructed. Phase III includes the construction of two additional office buildings totaling 98,488 square feet and associated site amenities.",

The White House and the Republican controlled Congress are arguing emphatically that corporate tax rates need to be reduced because the U.S. has the highest tax rate among the seven most developed economies in the world.\nYes, they are correct that the U.S. has the highest marginal rate, but U.S. corporations do not pay the most taxes. As seen below, and as reported by the White House and the Treasury Department in 2016, U.S. companies pay the fifth highest as measured by the effective rate. If the same tax breaks and financial loopholes remain AND their maximum tax rate declines from 35% to 20% U.S. corporations will be near the bottom. Why does this matter? Because of the United States government’s current budget debt of $20,496,092,622,812. Yep, it’s a lot…mucho grando. If a plan isn’t put into action to reduce it soon it may lead to economic trouble ahead.",

    "text": "This handpicked collection of handmade March birthstone jewelry includes an assortment of earrings, necklaces, rings, and charms (and one cuff bracelet) that feature the beautiful soft blue aquamarine stone. Bloodstone is also recognized as a March birthstone. In fact, until very recently, bloodstone was the primary stone, with aquamarine the secondary. It’s easy t see why the switch was made: Bloodstone jewelry is not easy to find, especially handmade jewelry. But I did manage to find and include one pair of bloodstone earrings for old-times’ sake. They won’t be hard for you to spot. Some of these beauties are in silver settings, some are in gold settings, and the range of prices will accommodate most shopper’s budgets. Birthstone jewelry is a wonderful connection to our past. The practice of wearing gemstones to attune to their vibratory powers is ancient. And associating specific gemstones with birth months goes back over 2000 years and has evolved along several separate cultural paths.

    "text": "Bio Polymer slurry trenching differ from normal slurry trenching in two ways. First, the slurry used to support the trench walls during excavation is made from a biodegradable material such as guar gum or polymer. Second, the trench backfill is a pervious material.\nAn important consideration when designing a trench excavated under bio-polymer slurry is to analyze the stability of the excavated trench. The characteristics of bio-polymer slurry are different from those of bentonite slurry. In particular, bio-polymer slurry does not maintain the soil particles in suspension after completion of the excavation, thereby significantly decreasing the hydrostatic pressure of the slurry against the trench wall after completion of the excavation. This could result in unstable trenches, mostly for deep trenches when the ground water is close to the work platform.",

    "text": "Hadoop is a highly scalable, NoSQL database used to perform high speed analytics against large volumes of data.\nHadoop works on the principle of schema on read, not schema on write. Any data (structured or unstructured) can be stored in Hadoop with out developing a schema. This cuts the development time scales, reduces risk complexity and reduces the impact of poor quality data that may have caused traditional ETL jobs to fail. Instead, consuming programs determine and apply structure when they access it.\nHadoop runs on commodity hardware. This makes it easily 10 times cheaper to deploy than the high end, specialised hardware used for typical enterprise data warehouse deployments (based on the average cost per terabyte of computing power). Where the average EDW may store and analyse around 15TB of data, typical Hadoop deployments may store and process a few hundred TB of data for the same cost.\nHadoop is fault tolerant. Hadoop copes with expected failures to the commodity hardware used through data replication and speculative processing. This means that Hadoop will run multiple copies of the same task (assuming resources are available) until one returns results.\nHadoop requires a new approach. Traditional BI and ETL tools are designed to work with predefined, structured schemas. While these tools can be made to work with Hadoop, typically through a Hive interface, this approach negates a key benefit of Hadoop – the reduction in development time and costs allowed by schema on read.\nHadoop is designed to answer different questions to those typically asked by BI tools, and new tools and methods are required to get real value.\n← Preconceived ideas lead to big data failures!",

    "text": "Your heart is possibly the most important life-producing organ in your body. It pumps blood to cells all through your body through blood vessels, carrying oxygen to all the areas that need it. Cardiac arrhythmia is a term that describes any abnormal beating of the heart. One of the most common forms of cardiac arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation (also called AF or A-Fib). It occurs when the two small upper chambers of the heart, called the atria, vibrate and quiver instead of beating effectively. This causes a lack of proper blood flow out of the atria. The blood in the atria then tends to build up and clot. If part of a blood clot escapes the heart and enters the arteries of the brain, it will cause a serious stroke.\nAbout 1% of Americans have atrial fibrillation, approximately 2 million people. 15% of these people have a stroke as a result. 3 to 5% of all people over 65 suffer from it, as the risk of getting it gets worse with age. A family history of atrial fibrillation can be a high risk factor, as can excessive alcohol use, already existing heart disease and high blood pressure. Atrial fibrillation can be either chronic, meaning symptoms last continually until treated. It can also be occasional, starting and stopping at random, lasting anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. The symptoms of this condition can vary depending on the person. Some people may not show any signs at all.\nThe most common signs include an abnormal fluttering sensation in the heart, palpitations of an irregular speed, chest pain, faintness, shortness of breath, low blood pressure and anxiety. If you or a loved one has atrial fibrillation, it has likely caused debilitating concerns.\nYou can file for Long Term Disability insurance benefits if you have LTD insurance, or you may qualify for disability benefits from Social Security.

This includes documents relating to your down payment (e.g. images of the canceled checks), and any other escrow paperwork. Do not throw these out. If you do not have these documents, you may lose your argument for any separate property interest in the house. The burden of proof is on the person who is claiming this interest, so keep that proof.\nAll prenuptial and/or post-nuptial agreements, and any addendums. Even if your spouse and you ignored these agreements throughout the marriage, they are still valid agreements, so it is vital to keep track of any addendums or revisions that may have been made throughout your marriage.\nFinancial statements for the date closest to your date of marriage. Don’t forget to keep a copy of your retirement account statements from the date of marriage as well. Your bank may not necessarily keep these records for you for longer than 7 years, so if you want to prove your pre-marital separate property, you need to keep these records.\nPlease keep in mind this list is not all-inclusive, and every case varies. However, having these records can go a long way towards facilitating a quick resolution for many of your more expensive financial issues.",

    "text": "Chelsea Handler Makes Her Next Move...And It's a Big One!\nDon't worry, the funny lady will still be around to make us laugh.\nEarlier this year, Chelsea Handler announced that Chelsea Lately would come to an end—and I, for one, was super bummed, because Handler has been the lone female voice in late night talk shows for, well, ever, basically. As much as I love Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert, post-11:30 p.m. TV would be a lot...quieter (and tamer) without Handler.\nTo my relief, Handler just announced her next move, and it's a big one—the comedienne is headed to Netflix, where she'll launch an on-demand new talk show in 2016. Obviously, that's not nearly soon enough, so, to tide us over, she's airing a stand-up special based on her latest book, “Uganda Be Kidding Me,” on October 16, and a series of docu-specials, tacking topics from NASCAR and politics to the NBA draft and Silicon Valley, throughout 2015. I mean, who does't want to hear Handler riff on Nascar?\nIt should be super interesting to see how Handler's new show fares on a network that's made it's name on binge-watching (try to tell me you didn't watch all of Orange Is The New Black or House of Cards in one go, I dare you). Obviously, the talk shows as we know them are meant to be watched nightly, as a reaction to the news of the day. Will people start tuning in to Netflix as if it was just another channel, or will people end up watching old news on demand? Late night TV has already seen a ton of shake-ups this year (see: Fallon, Meyers and Colbert), but, if anyone could take a step further, my money's on Handler.",

And it would have cost these sellers little, if anything, to simply use a lease that allowed for an owner to move in given proper notice and, possibly, appropriate compensation.\nPerhaps you’re a duplex owner who can’t imagine selling. Maybe you don’t think your duplex is the kind of place any owner would want to live in. But in either case, does it hurt to simply use a lease that gives a buyer that option?",

For many of us in the business of offering feminist critiques of popular culture in the twenty-first century, it can seem like we‘re simply tilting at windmills. This article touches on those sensations of boredom and ennui which trouble a feminist cultural critic attempting to make sense of the postfeminist distractions of popular culture. Yet I will also try to inject some new interest into this study by identifying how postfeminism becomes more and more an empty signifier, not simply because it has become overburdened with meanings over the past two decades, but also and more significantly because the majority of the audience it addresses when ventriloquising a form of \"old\" feminism simply don‘t recognise the feminist rhetoric that it is parasitic upon.",

Think about it – you only displayed on screen the exact same data that is already stored on your harddisk anyway. And if anyone could access your scrollback or your history, they could just as well read the id_rsa file directly.\nBesides, your shell's history – even if it was readable to other users (which it isn't) – only contains commands, not their output. So all it'll have is a line with cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa in it.\nThe scrollback history, for most terminals, is stored entirely in memory. (libvte-based terminals sometimes use a backing file in /tmp, but that's either a tmpfs or is located in the same disk as your ~/.ssh, anyway...) So it becomes irrelevant once you close the terminal. And either way it is only accessible to you, of course.\nAnd very often, the private key itself is encrypted with a passphrase and is unusable unless you decrypt it when ssh asks to.\nUnless, of course, you did this in the presence of high-resolution security cameras, or even outright allowed someone to snap a photo of your terminal window. In that case, someone could retype the key from photos, and the only thing protecting it would be the encryption passphrase.\nNot the answer you're looking for?

When they're ready later this summer the consultants will be back in Yakima.\n\"We'll create some forums so people can come and take a look at what they came up with and ask more questions.\" Wilkenson says. \"They'll then go back to their offices and come up with a final proposal.\"\nThat final design will then be presented to the council for approval. If that happens, the city will then begin the work to find the funding for the project that is estimated between $4 million and $12 million.",

At both schools, Duncan led an inspirational assembly followed by a fun swimming session.\nDuring the school assembly, Duncan spoke of his childhood and how he lived with both dyslexia and hair loss, which had made his school days very difficult. Demonstrating an aptitude for swimming, he soon realised that sport could help to rebuild his self-esteem. This spurred him on to make his way to the top and aged 23, he won an Olympic gold medal for Great Britain in 100m Breaststroke. During his talk, he taught the children some valuable lessons, such as to believe in yourself and to never give up when the going gets tough.\nDuncan also passed around his gold medal and Olympic torch and there was also an opportunity at the end for the children to ask him lots of questions. After the assembly, Duncan led a fun swimming session with a group of 9-10 year olds. During this time, they were treated with games, races, prizes and some top tips from Duncan.\nSchool Swimathon is setting a challenge to pupils across the country to develop their swimming ability and swim further than they have ever swum before. The Swimathon Foundation and Swim England are helping pupils across the country to 'Swim their Best' for School Swimathon 2018. The programme challenges pupils to swim further than ever before whilst improving their technique in the water.",

A special page has been set up for the challenge here. By clicking on the “Challenge” button, teachers, parents, and youth will find contest details, including activities to learn more about the issues we are facing, and challenges to tackle these issues head on.\nChallenges include joining the popular #trashtag effort to clean wetlands, creeks and beaches. Wetlands are important for many reasons including flood protection and as carbon sinks. Other potential activities include planting indigenous trees to absorb carbon and give off oxygen. As part of the contest entry, participants must submit a multimedia entry (e.g. video, photo essay, drawings, etc.) that demonstrates their super power efforts and invites others to join in.\nParticipants will be entered to win water prizes including, for class entries, a 2-hour boat charter on Okanagan Lake for an on-the-water classroom experience to learn more about the water in the valley. Entries are due April 30, 2019. Full details are available here.\nThe partners of the youth challenge include: City of Vernon, City of Kelowna and YMCA H2O Adventure & Fitness Centre, City of Penticton, The Okanagan Science Centre, Regional District of Central Okanagan’s Environmental Education Centre of the Okanagan, Kelowna Cruises and Cruise Okanagan.",

This is usually brought about by ocean waves and strong winds that are too strong for the Airboat to withstand. It is such an absurd situation because instead of saving lives, we end up losing more. It is for this reason that this amazing product has been designed to avert such undesirable situations. It is a floatation system that will be able to flat in rough lakes and fast current. The project aims at saving lives and promoting the use of safe Airboats all over the world. It prevents sinking rescue missions .This is utterly impressive. Let’s find out more.\n1 pair PVC inflatable tubes 16’ long.\nThe product comes in various colors, sizes and shapes. It is very affordable due to its competitive price which varies between $2,995 to $16,786.\nThis exemplary product installs on standard aluminum hull Airboat. It is promising to revolutionize the use of safe Airboats by making them more sable and being able to go through rough seas without sinking. The tubes are well installed and do not alter the dynamics of normal water operation. In addition, they are simple, removable, look professional and are highly functional. They excellently provide over 3000lbs of floatation while adding only 50lbs of weight. This helps to prevent sinking rescue missions hence saving lives. Furthermore, installing them is quite easy.\nPlans are underway to promote the tubes and market them to Fire Departments in USA and Canada. This will prevent sinking rescue missions thereby saving the lives of many people.\nThis remarkable product was developed based on CAD solid works program. The first stage of development has already been completed. Its patent is pending. A factory is already set to begin producing them in large numbers.\nIn conclusion, this product will bring a total change in Airboat rescue missions. Its safety is just unsurpassed. It will surely help to prevent sinking rescue missions. We are waiting. What a product.",

    "text": "The ECoSDetector Standard is made for all model railroaders who look for a reliable and affordable feeback module without needing the expandable functions of the ECoSDetector. The ECoSDetector Standard is primarily meant to be a substitute for the aged s88 feedback modules: modifications on track work wiring are not necessary.\nThe ECoSDetector is able to monitor up to 16 track sections and reports the presence of a loco (track occupancy). Operation with every 3-digit track is possible, no matter if you have a M-, K-, or C-track.\nAlternatively the 16 inputs can be used as conventional switch inputs: Connect the reed contacts as well as the contact tracks or switches (and toggle switches) with it and handle the information given with the help of your central station.\nEvery ECoSDetector Standart can be directly connected to the command station via the ECoSlink bus. Beside all ECoS command stations you can also use the Central StationÂ® (updated with the Central StationÂ® with software upgrade by ESU). The module will be automatically linked to the command station and also graphically configured.",

The FIN-30 is perfect for powering sauna rooms up to 130 adjusted cubic feet (ACF).\nThe FIN-30 heater features durable stainless-steel elements for years of exceptional performance and maintenance-free operation. The unit is designed so that the rocks are in direct contact with the heating elements for greater efficiency. Its large rock capacity ensures a more even and consistent heat.\nThe FIN 30 has a power rating of 3 kilowatts. The unit is available in 240V, single-phase or 208V, three-phase configurations. The heater may be ordered with the standard red finish or the optional stainless-steel exterior (FIN-30-S).\nFIN Series sauna heaters require the use of a wall-mounted control for operation. Located outside the sauna room, the control allows bathers to adjust features such as bathing duration (1-60 minutes) and temperature. Select the available control that best suits your preferences.\nThe FIN 30 heater carries a limited lifetime warranty and, unlike cheap imitations, is fully serviceable. FIN series electric sauna heaters are UL and ETL listed for unmatched safety and quality.\nFor sauna rooms up to 130 cu. ft.",

The temporary boutique consists of a collection of interactive vignette photo-ops, all of which help to shed light on the elevated musical dimensions of Bang & Olufsen, as well as allow for the visitor to be immersed in the B&O listening experience.\nUpon entering The Music Box, visitors are invited to enjoy the Bronze Collection, an exclusive colorway that unites Bang & Olufsen’s best multiroom speakers in one space. Emblazoned with a giant sound-generating pendulum, users are able to listen to musical notes through a Beoplay A9 speaker. But the highlight of The Music Box is housed in the rear, which contains the B&O jazz club, in every sense of the word — dimly lit, curtain-lined, and showcasing the newly released Late Night Blue Collection. The collection is a nod at the old-school iconic jazz clubs of New York – except maybe minus the Beoplay A1 Bluetooth speaker and the Beoplay E8 wireless earphones, which are 100% present in this spot.\nOther interactive parts of the musical oasis include a brightly colored room displaying the new Beosound Edge, the award-winning wireless speaker (which features the world’s first active bass port), and a cozy living room that shows how the state-of-the-art Beolab 90 loudspeakers (which boast more than 16,000 watts of acoustic power) can easily fit into any living space.\nThe Music Box by Bang & Olufsen is open now at 121 Spring Street.",
